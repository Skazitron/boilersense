course,review
EAPS 100,"I took EAPS100 online first semester this year. I had professor eddy, and the course was extremely easy. Essentially, I had two modules assigned each week with lecture content ranging from 15 minutes to 2 hours in length. Longer lectures were pretty rare, but expect to dedicate At least 2 hours to watching lectures each week. The content was easy to grasp, and professor eddy was super thorough and provides multiple examples if you’re confused. I found most of the content to be pretty intuitive. After each lecture, you take a short multiple choice homework assignment. The class was really low stakes as every homework assignment was due two weeks after it was assigned. Also, you had two attempts on the midterm and final exams. I never read the textbook (which isn’t necessarily required) and took semi detailed notes in each lecture and I got 100% on the midterms and finals on my first attempt. The midterms and finals are also open note. The only thing that was slightly annoying is that your homework grade is the average of all three of your attempts, so if you mess up one attempt, you have to do all three to boost the average for that assignment. Not a huge issue as I was getting 100 on my first try most of the time. Overall, this course did not contribute any stress to my semester, I only recommend that you don’t let the lectures pile up even though they’re due two weeks after the due date."
EAPS 100,"EDPS is more or less a free A if you turn all your stuff in on time, the others could be an issue though- all are pretty time intensive"
EAPS 100,Yeah it's pretty easy and is a good padding for your GPA since you're taking Calc 2.
EAPS 100,EAPS 100 is super easy. Just study the powerpoints and pay somewhat attention and you got an A. I WOULD recommend though you be careful; your workload in general is already pretty meaty.
EAPS 100,Easy.
EAPS 100,So easy its actually comical. Theres no final just do the homework and discussion due once a week and its an easy A
EAPS 100,"A few hours a week, and if you do the assignments and study at least a tiny bit for each exam, you should easily be able to get an A"
MA 261,"Currently a sophomore in AAE. I took AB got a 4. Went back and took MA 165 and 166. MA 166 for me was a breeze. I used high school notes and received an easy A. If I were you I would go straight to 261 if you feel confident enough. MA 166 and MA 261 don’t correlate a ton. Just a matter of how well you understand Calc 1.

Either way just know Purdue math blows. Like it sucks. I head a lot of people complain how they liked calc 1 and hated calc 2 then ended up loving calc 3. I was opposite than them even though I received Bs in both calc 1 and calc 3.

Just base your decision on how confident in the math you have already learned."
MA 261,"Oh boy.

So I took AP Calc AB and went straight into calc 2 at purdue and took ma261 my second semester. While I ended up doing well in both, Calc 2 is known to be extremely difficult at Purdue. If there is anyway you can get credit for it beforehand (like community college), that would be great.

MA261 appears to change every semester. When I took it, averages were generally high and I didn't think it was hard. However, apparently last year it was insanely hard. Regardless, if you legit put the effort into understanding the course material, you should be okay."
MA 261,"Run away from Purdue's Calc 2. I'm in 261 right now and overall I think it's better than 162 since they don't try to gun through too much in too little time, like Taylor Series and that kind of fun stuff."
MA 261,Always.Get.Out.of.ANY.Purdue.Math.You.Can. NO. EXCEPTIONS.

CS 250,"Also no hate to the professor at all, I think his lectures are great but his mini-exams and homework are way harder than they should be in my opinion"
CS 250,I agree his wording is pretty difficult. I hope there’s a curve and there might be but no guarantee
CS 250,"He always says he won’t curve it but he ends up giving a pretty thick curve, I had a 60 in first midterm and 70 in another and 70 in finals and I got an A. I know it’s different for u guys but I feel it will be fine :)"
CS 250,This class is so fucking hard bruh
CS 250,Agree on the exams and as someone barley passing the class I hope there is a curve for the final
SOC 100,"I'm in it right now, it's beyond easy but the professor is way too excited to be teaching it and tries too hard to be funny all the time which makes it awkward. Not hard at all, but not a fun class by any means"
SOC 100,I'm in the online section. It might be the easiest class I've ever taken. I did all of the reading quizzes for the semester in about 3 hours the first day they were released and spent about an hour each on the three homeworks. For the quizzes and exams (also on blackboard on your own computer) you can Google for the answers.
SOC 100,It's a pretty easy class. They release all the reading quizzes at the beginning of the semester so you can get them done in one day and the exams are all multiple choice. It's almost impossible to fail.
SOC 100,Is that for the online course or the in person or hybrid course?
SOC 100, like it... it's easy and not horribly boring. Also predominately common sense. I recommend Tom Mahe
