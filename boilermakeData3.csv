4735,Literally one of the worst professors at Purdue University. He just fought with whole class over demonstrating some specific gravity problem because he gave us 2 minutes to complete it and virtually no understood question asked. Virtually incomprehensible in class. I cant believe this is who hired teach hard a class..,2,😎awesome,2.0
4736,Curves tests and overall class. Threw out all quiz grades gave 100s if you showed up for the quiz. Dropped lowest test of 4.,1,😖awful,1.0

4745,"He just gets word files on the projector and keeps reading it (tries to joke sometimes- but he's so bad at them), For IE 590 he'll ask TAs set a score of 83 start deducting/adding points from there. Just professor. Don't ever take graduate class with him. The grading is random!. I hurt my GPA this class.",1,😖awful,2.0
4746,"He is a fair professor as he challenges graduate students to go out and do the extra bit research in order be prepared for lectures assignments. Though it can difficult understand how things are being graded fair. I wish him his TAs didn't grade hard grammar, but overall learned lot regards systems thinking.",1,😖awful,1.0
4747,Worst worst Prof ever. Few guidelines for paper while grading extremely harsh. There was no rubric and they just gave out points as felt like. Projects submitted by companies are very easy we were asked to do simple tasks again again. To be honest it is really wasting time. Barely learned anything. Avoid him sure.,1,😖awful,2.0
4748,I would rather commit suicide than take another class with this professor. This guy is incorrigible and apathetic.,2,😎awesome,2.0
4749,This prof does not teach but rather discusses vague ideas related to statistics. He spends little time in class showing the mechanics behind solving a problem and use examples class. The TA is only hope. Avoid this professor at all costs.,1,😎awesome,2.0
4750,One of the worst profs I have had at Purdue. spends entire lecture reading paragraphs jibberish and no time teaching how to do actual problems. He has yet an example this is a math class.,1,😖awful,1.0
4751,"He is the worst professor I have had in all my four years hear at Purdue. That pretty much sums it up. I've been class for over two months now and haven't learned a thing. Classes like his are reason IE referred to as ""Imaginary Engineers"". has pleasant enough demeanor but completely selfish educator. Avoid if possible.",2,😖awful,2.0
4752,"This is a senior design class and he emphasis on writing skill rather than the real engineering stuff how team have help customer. All grades based deliverable, where huge potion of points are deducted for small spelling mistake while typos in his email himself too. He **** too, so choose American teammate.",1,😖awful,1.0
4753,"He is not very good at all. teaches IE but has psych degrees. a horrible person, soo much. well slightly.",2,😖awful,2.0
4754,"Literally the WORST. Complete Ego maniac! Lectures are complete waste, gives no help when requested. Amazing he still continues to teach at purdue! Waste Do Not Take!",1,😖awful,1.0
4755,"Had heard some negative things going into the class about professor but as long you keep an open mind and have a willingness to go him for help/guidance, semester shouldn't be too bad. Can vague at times this is intentional because he wants help not handed solution.",2,😖awful,2.0
4756,"his name said it all, ""B.S."" Caldwell...",1,😖awful,1.0
4757,"He is very liberal in teaching style, likes to ramble and describe things that have no link engineering from an aspect. His notes are NOT helpful because they huge paragraphs of nonsense. It's hard find out what the important information lectures. Lalaine, TA, however, does a good job sorting through all his bul",2,😖awful,2.0
4758,Not to be mean but he is the worst I have ever had and think most ppl in class agree pretty much. We learn nothing for real don't has such credibility eligibility teach our class. took 330 332 twice be4 w/ him feel useless infront of others that from other prof. compared them....,1,😖awful,1.0
4759,The course has been murdered by Prof. Caldwell. There is no sense of order in what he teaching. projects and notes have presented the vaguest possible manner. Grading almost random it seems that there structure to course. He just teaches whatever on his mind. I hope nobody take a under him.,2,😖awful,2.0
4760,"Caldwell's ""alternative"" teaching technique is in essence an excuse to do minimal work terms of and helping students while using for his research purposes. I learned nothing from him 332 class expect learn no more 486.",1,😖awful,1.0
4761,I wish he'd start teaching for a change.. talks 40 mins of useless information in the most vague manner possible. . lecture notes on slide again are pointless.. does not look at course from students point view.. i think he knows isnt good teacher and thus grade is left projects etc .. LEARN ON YOUR OWN POLICY,2,😖awful,2.0
4762,"Without exaggerating, the worst prof I've Ever Had. During an hour lecture, he would spend only 5 minutes teaching vague formulas that didn't apply, and rest on ""housekeeping"" (maintaining his own WebCT account). Offered little help, often belittle student's who approach him with questions. You'll have to learn everything your own!",1,😖awful,1.0
