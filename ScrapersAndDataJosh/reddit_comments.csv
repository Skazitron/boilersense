1,CS25200,"If you have gone so far that you can't use make/compile anymore and don't know how to fix it, I would go back to a previous commit that has compilable code. You can use gitk to find out what commit has what changes and you can compare and contrast between your commits.

Also please email your TA or professor about your situation. Gustavo is very nice and understanding of student situation and he can work with you."
2,CS25200,"I'm not sure why you named Turkstra specifically -- we didn't work on a server/client, only had homeworks (labs were office hours, and no projects), and they were all (almost all?) about structs, pointers, and various operations like bitshifting.  

I will agree though that Turkstra is underappreciated in 240. Most students I talk to say that he was a really bad prof and that he killed CS240 students, but I feel like that's just not true. Turk may have some flaws on a personal level but I feel like he was a good professor. Sure, the quizzes were frustrating to deal with at times (being quizzed on something at the end of the lecture it was taught), but his lectures were concise and easy to understand, his homeworks were difficult but not jarringly so, and the exams (minus the final, which was oddly a killer in contrast) were really straightforward provided that you did the homework leading up to it and did the practice exam & maybe some light review."
3,CS25200,Probably yes. I’m also taking it next semester and have no idea of what to expect. My best guess is that he’s gonna include his code standard and change the exam style just like he did for 240.
4,CS25200,"I'm taking it next semester as well. I talked to Turkstra, and some of the labs will be tweaked. In particular, the multi-threading and concurrency lab will be made more difficult and the final lab that's currently a web server will be swapped for something else. The good new is, Turkstra's specialty is systems"

12,CS25200,"I've said this before--I honestly think CS252's difficulty is over-exaggerated. Start when the lab is assigned, go to lectures to get advice from Gustavo, ask TA's for clarification on concepts, and know what the systems calls actually do, and put forth a couple of hours each day to code and the class is super manageable. If anything, it's just a time-suck. However, time-suck does not equal difficult, and a lot of people wrongly equate the two (likely due to procrastination)."

16,CS25200,"He's not wrong. The class isn't nearly as hard as half of the CS student body exaggerates it to be. It's mainly the volume of work, which isn't too hard to deal with if you don't blow at time management. Conceptually, the class isn't actually that bad."
17,CS25200,"Do you want to stay in CS?

If you do, it's better to stay in the class. Every time I've been worried about my performance in class I think about it this way: I either work my ass off and somehow get a C, or I don't, but I've worked my ass off and I'm that much better prepared for next time. Trust me, whether you pass or fail, you'd be grateful, whether once grades come in or the following semester when you're killing it. 

I've been there. I failed and retook 180 after a similar experience (feeling completely in over my head and incapable of completing any of the projects) and it dinged my ego a bit at the time but once I got over that it was a really positive experience and made me into the student I am today, and I never would've thought it was possible but a class that made no sense to me the first time around I rocked the second time. The fact that I stuck with it and didn't drop had something to do with that. And so far I've been a pretty successful CS student ever since.

So if you want to stay in cs my advice would be don't give up just yet. Lots of people face setbacks, and retaking a cs class is more common than you would think. You might think, ""I'm so behind, what's the point in even starting?"" But honestly, so what? You get something out of it either way, whether it's the grade you want or the knowledge to do better next time. 

You're gonna be fine. Hang in there, I promise it'll all be okay eventually. "
18,CS25200,"Talk to your advisor, talk to the professor. See if there's a way you can possibly recover your grade, the semester isn't even half over. That said, your mental health is more important than struggling through a class you'll fail, and if dropping the course and taking it again with a better plan next semester is going to help your mental state more than staying in, then you should do that. "
19,CS25200,"If all that is due right now is part 1 then you can still complete the shell. There is no reason to drop the class, especially since you know you're going to need to take it over again. There is no getting around it.

I have spent many semesters working for your prof on this course and have had to assist more students with this project than any other, by a long shot. Not even with both the grad and undergrad compilers courses have people had as many issues as with the shell project, perhaps because of the fact that you are learning three things at once in a short time span. But there is no one, if they could get through the earlier courses, who is incapable of completing the shell.

If it's being taught any way similarly to how it was a few years ago, part 1 is a minimal amount of work, perhaps less than you think. Wait until the entire project is over before making a decision. "
20,CS25100,"If it’s anything like last semester, it’s not too difficult a class to pass. I had a tougher time with CS182 and CS240. The biggest things are to stay on top of the projects and homework, starting them early and giving yourself plenty of time to figure them out since they can take a while if you get stumped."
21,CS25100,"if it's the same as this semester, try to save your homework days (you get 3) as that will add extra credit. this helped me a lot and saved my grade. Also, start on the projects the very early so you have enough time"

28,CS25100,"I'm not sure about Sacks, but to discuss your point about Turkstra, I would say Turkstra is pretty unique. Turk's low RMP score mainly stems from people thinking he's a dick given his rigidity on things like coding style in addition to his bluntness. He's actually not a bad lecturer and his exams are very fair. I wouldn't expect Turkstra's situation to apply to many other professors."

Also, this is a bad idea. Ask anyone who took OS in the Spring about what happened with the Facebook group they decided to make. I wasn't in the class so I don't know what the final outcome was there, but I'm sure it wasn't good."

Don't get me wrong, some of the questions on there were very probably designed to screw you over (and some of them are just objectively graded incorrectly), but that didn't seem to be the majority.

His lectures are pretty good, so I doubt he's trying to be malicious. Just writes hard exams, I guess.

88,CS25000,"Yeah I think he experimented a bit too much with our semester. The mini exams were introduced to be a low stakes alternative to regular midterms, in an effort to reduce stress, but actually (at least for me) had the opposite effect. I also feel like he wasted the first 5 weeks not having a single mini exam, which resulted in 8 consecutive weeks of mini exams. That, along with labs (most weeks) and hws (all weeks iirc) was absolute hell. 

Also kind of annoying that he did all that experimentation with group discussions, only to cancel them and void the credit for the first group discussion that actually took place.

Based on the reviews of him on this sub and on ratemyprofessor in previous semesters, I’m sure he’s a great professor. That is also evident through his lectures. His decision making this semester though, was questionable. Well he still has time to make it up with the curve, and I really hope he’s fair with it :)"

I'm kinda curious as to what 250 with Adams (or even a throwback to when Comer still taught it) would be like. Took it with Bellur and Xu and somehow grabbed an A+ on the midterm, which saved my ass big time since I got a 33% on the final and 0's on two of the four quizzes and still kept a B in the course overall. The second half of the semester went from 0 to 100 in a second lol. I heard Comer's classes got to do some crazy projects that actually used most of the shit we get in our breadboard kits.

If you take practice exams and do well on them you should be fine, they usually reuse questions too. I’m gonna be honest though, in my opinion this class is not very fun. A lot of stuff is just more complicated/redundant  than it needs to be and most of the assignments are pretty basic and boring."

A lot of it is making sure you understand how logic statements and booleans work, so they don't let you use if statements until a fair bit into the class; it sounds a lot dumber that it really is tbh. 

> different text editors are non-negotiable?

literally no one gives a shit if you use a different editor. They show you everything in VI, which makes a fair bit of sense, but if you want to do everything in a different editor or environment...go ahead, so long as it still passes all the test cases when you shove it through their compiler."

175,CS15900,"Honestly thinking about it after a few hours, I probably could’ve studied more. The 2 types of problems, which a TA in lab said, were the following through code/saying what is outputted and the true/false questions, which was my main issue.

176,CS15900,"That’s exactly how I feel, I took two years of Java in high school and have gotten great grades on all the homework’s and labs up to this points. But the wording of the questions feels like they are trying to get as far away from the actual concept as possible."

182,CS15900,I had the same thinking early on but honestly learning C is a blessing in disguise cause no language seems tough after that and the kind of understanding C gives you because of how low level it is hardly any language will help you learn your concepts that well.
183,CS15900,You got that right. It’s frustrating when someone who got more than 95% on every lab and hw is averaging a 62 on these practice exams
184,CS15900,My issue really isn’t with the language C. My first choice would be python but I can get over myself of that one. The issue is when you write a 13 or so page coding standard packet and then break every rule on your exams 🤷‍♂️
185,CS15900,"Dude C is used everywhere. Anywhere which used embedded systems, engines, plane landing controls, 3D printers, etc. All electronic items which when it comes down to at least the functionality of them use embedded systems to run, which requires programming in low level languages like C / C++ and Assembly.  

Now I think what you may be frustrated with is the CS departments way of teaching you a new programming language. They do their best, but when it comes down to it they focus on the theory aspects way more than the application of it. CS theory exams are meaningless when it comes to on the job experience, but actually practicing and working with the languages in projects and real life problems makes learning the language worth it."

217,CS15900,"I’m in this same class, and yeah it’s been interesting. I definitely agree it’s the ECE department at fault here and not so much the instructor. He has a lot of work to do and he’s basically on his own. They should have given him way more support/assign more instructors to the class because clearly this isn’t working, and they’re making a ton of money off those taking this class. Pretty ridiculous in all."

224,CS15900,"I had Crum this past semester and though lectures got a little boring sometimes, he was a decent lecturer and gave a solid intro to C -- Granted I've had some programming experience (HS Course 2 years ago). Most of my friends didn't have a problem with him as well. I've heard Bunning was good too though, but also a little boring.

To speak for the course, it does kind of throw you into coding and some early units were pretty conceptually challenging. Would recommend getting a small head start if possible but I have friends who didn't start early and still did well in the course."

284,CS35500,"Currently taking CS381 under him. His teaching is very good, and while he deviates from the topic fairly frequently, he says really fun and interesting stuff that's applicable for anyone. At this time I like him.

For that class he's delegated the grading to the head TA however (i.e he does not grade the homework). Our midterm was all MCQ as well, though the average was reasonable."
285,CS35500,"I just finished up the course with Maji. It was the hardest class I’ve ever taken at Purdue, surpassing some of the stereotypically “hard” ones like 381 and OS by a long shot. 
That being said I did quite well in the course and Maji seems to pass people who put in the effort, but it was an extremely challenging course — the homeworks were really tough and the lectures were really advanced. A lot of math is involved, particularly proofs. 
I have not had personal experience with Wagstaff but I have friends who took it the last time he taught and it seems to have been a much easier course, more focused on computations and historical context than the crazy proofs we were doing. 
Maji is very enthusiastic but he teaches the course at almost a graduate level and at times I felt so inundated with information it was hard for me to get a lot out of it. Yes, he gives an extremely generous curve so passing isn’t really an issue if you try, but it is a lot to process. From what I’ve heard, Wagstaff’s crypto is a bit more on par with what a typical undergraduate CS course looks like. 
TL;DR varying difficulties but in either case you should be able to get a decent grade, just depends on what kind of experience you want. "
286,CS24000,"Hey there,

I took 240 with Turkstra a couple years back, props for trying to prep in advance. C is very much like Java in terms of syntax (since Java syntax was in fact inspired by C), so I don't think you'll have too much trouble. So I would just take a nice primer course on the language, perhaps this one: [https://youtu.be/KJgsSFOSQv0](https://youtu.be/KJgsSFOSQv0)

From what I remember, the hardest parts about that class/C were pointers, dynamic memory allocation/freeing (i.e. malloc), linked lists, and trees. If you cover the course above well and maybe write some programs related to the subjects mentioned, you'll be more than ready for 240.

And if that's a lot for one break, don't be too intimidated. I didn't know any C before going in and I did fine in the course, as did many other students. Best of luck, and feel free to PM me if you have any other questions :)"

The only hiccup I've ever noticed in a Turkstra class was that our final project in CS 240 had a bit tighter of a deadline than it probably should have initially, but Turkstra ended up being *more* than forgiving with the final grading in the end since enough people expressed their concerns.

This set me back by 1 whole day.

During this call with the 4 TAs, one TA asked another one if he had done the project to which the other TA replied he did not. My understanding was that the TAs are supposed to do the same work we do so that they can help us. I'm really disappointed in how this is going.

During this call with the 4 TAs, one TA asked another one if he had done the project to which the other TA replied he did not. My understanding was that the TAs are supposed to do the same work we do so that they can help us. I'm really disappointed in how this is going.

There are some really nice TAs that are understanding and helpful but not enough to help everyone that needs help. They take about 2 hours for one TA to get through 4-6 people and by then, office hours ends and the remaining students receive no help."
311,CS24000,"Some of those TAs I personally know, and they're good TAs. But only the GTAs have to ""implement"" the project which I'm not even sure if they do. If it was a short project, then it wouldn't be so bad, but something like this where I've heard from you guys that instructions are vague, and the project is long, it's pretty bad. So yeah, you've been screwed over."

So although the project may have been extremely easy for you, it might be a bit more difficult for them as they might just be lacking experience.

Yes the complaints are annoying but completely dismissing them and stating you were able to do the project in a single week is a little bit unrealistic for some students in that class, most of them are still freshman."

338,CS24000,"I agree. He lays out the information very nicely and clearly knows what he’s talking about in lecture. However, I found that if ever needed help or clarification one of two things happened. Either I got sort of a “so what” response as if he couldn’t understand why someone would have trouble understanding it the first time around(forgetting don’t have a PhD) or he’d be really bad at dumbing down his explanation/explaining it differently.

Also, the BIG thing is the exam are written(yes - you really do write code on paper) and not live coding. This forces you to have a better understanding of the material but fails to let you run your code. I received points off many times for not covering edge cases that I would have been reminded of had there been test cases for me to run with my code on a live coding exam.

———————————

Edit(Just to give my opinions on some things that have been mentioned):

Quizzes: Aren’t that bad. If you are understanding the material, a quick look at your notes (the night) before every class should be fine.

Homeworks: Together with quizzes are about half you’re grade. Make sure that you stay on top of them as mentioned below. Also - The code standard. Turkstra lives and dies by his code standard. It is strict, but it will make your code look beautiful or you will lose points."

I will agree though that Turkstra is underappreciated in 240. Most students I talk to say that he was a really bad prof and that he killed CS240 students, but I feel like that's just not true. Turk may have some flaws on a personal level but I feel like he was a good professor. Sure, the quizzes were frustrating to deal with at times (being quizzed on something at the end of the lecture it was taught), but his lectures were concise and easy to understand, his homeworks were difficult but not jarringly so, and the exams (minus the final, which was oddly a killer in contrast) were really straightforward provided that you did the homework leading up to it and did the practice exam & maybe some light review."

That being said, a lot of classes are not easy at all. You may have problems with Algorithms, OS, Compilers, Crypto, and many others. Not everybody is good at all of these subjects and classes vary every semester. You'll eventually have to learn that not every topic is easy.

400,CS18200,"It really depends on:

* who you ask
* what prof they had

I personally enjoyed 251, even with a prof that most people were annoyed with (Hoffman, though more were annoyed with his head TA mainly). 251 was interesting to me because now that I'd finally gotten the basics of Java and C out of the way, I got to start doing semi important shit and actually implement some good basic algorithms and data structures. If you're going through Purdue CS aiming to be a SWE, (read: 90% of Purdue's CS student body) then 251 is a good first step to developing marketable skills for coding interviews and such. 

Gustavo's main strength is that his classes generally feature a couple of really neat and practical projects that are usually worth holding onto in a small archive on your GitHub. They're not all just basic, canned coding tasks to prove a simple point. On top of that, none of Gustavo's projects or exams are ever unfairly difficult; he's pretty good a gauging what the average student should know if they genuinely tried in his class.

Having Adams for 250 and Gustavo for 251 should be pretty enjoyable, honestly. I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."

408,CS18200,"Your not alone. Cs182 might contain important material, but it's definitely a class that saps people's enthusiasm for cs.  It's incredibly tedious, poorly run,  fairly challenging, and not relevant to pretty much anything else your covering at the moment. People like to say it's fundamental to your degree but I don't believe it is. Cs251 is a much better version of this class and it will make a lot more sense. It's a much more practical extension of what you learn in 182.  Hang in there :)"

413,CS19100,WTF did the advisors do to CS 191. When I took it we only had about 13 assignments that took like 30 minutes or less to do for each of them. Like half the credit was based off you attending 12/15 lectures for the class.

420,CS19300,"The problem is that culinary definitions aren't structural. All of these types of arguments apply overly reductionist reasoning that completely ignore critical factors: culture, preparation, flavor type, ingredients, temperature, setting, meal type, etc.

So sure, you can argue that a pizza is an open faced sandwich the same way you can argue a bird is a type of bat because they both have wings the same way you can argue an atom is a star system because they both have subcomponents that orbit a central mass, but these aren't useful definitions to anyone."

423,CS35200,"352 with Prof. Li was pretty good, you use yacc and lex for parsing, and either c or c++ for interpreting and compiling (you choose). Towards the  the end of the semester you gotta write some arm assembly for compiling to raspberry pis. The project is probably the hardest you'll do for your cs undergrad and it will be a huge mess by the end of the semester, so don't take the class lightly. That said i loved suffering in this class because the material is pretty cool stuff. Your grade will generally reflect the amount of time you put into the class as it's mostly project based and Li's exams are very fair."

425,CS35200,"Honestly, during the semester I hated my life and the project sucked every ounce of energy out of me, but it was extremely rewarding to learn how programs *really* work. Would I take it again despite the suffering? Absolutely.

Prof. Li is also very reasonable and kind. His lecture slides are a bit confusing, but the information isn't hard to find elsewhere if his explanations don't stick. If you're ever confused with the material, he is very approachable for help. The deadlines for everything are going to seem fast, so make sure you stay on top of the work!

Also, IIRC, he changes which language that is implemented each time he teaches the course."
