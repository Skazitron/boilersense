0,very standard b+
1,lmao good to know I'm not alone. I was so fucked because I studied hard for the last few chapters but they pulled out so many shit from the first few chapters. I walked out confident but I guess I made too many mistakes. My grade tanked from 89 to 72 and I'm just praying it's going up to a B- haha
2,"Not bragging, but I've had constant 84s in past two exams and finals says I got 40%. I'm like actually confused, but I'm ready to accept that I'm retarded if they didn't make a mistake."
3,Dude holy shit I feel you. All there's left to do is bank on the curve because damn that went awfully
4,nah I feel the same way. I definitely thought I got more right
5,"Loved 261! Got an A in 1987. Failed Physics 152 the same semester...ðŸ˜†.
Don't worry ya'll, the secret is to...JUST. KEEP. GOING!!!! You can do it!"
6,"Did not get a 70, that would have been nice"
7,I have a 64 in that class right now...fml
8,"Make sure you know how to integrate. I know that may seem obvious but on the last exam, we were kind of told we didnâ€™t have to solve actual integrals but we did. 

Other than that, make sure you actually understand the homework and arenâ€™t just breezing through it. Itâ€™s ok if you donâ€™t understand stuff right away but make time to review the material (namely the homework), whichâ€™ll be especially helpful for recitation quizzes. 

As long as you give yourself enough time, youâ€™ll most likely be fine!"
9,"Itâ€™s not bad. Itâ€™s what youâ€™ve already learned but in 3D and adding vectors. Vector calc can get a little hairy, but you can get a fairly decent grasp of it if you seriously take the time to understand the intuition rather than memorizing formulas. Watch the 3B1B videos.

Itâ€™s also incredibly useful if you continue with MechE/aero/fluids classes. Take the time to understand the material, your future self will thank you for it."
10,oh gosh yeah that jump is going to be painful...
11,if you fail calc 3 just take it again next semester and whatever you get will replace the grade in your gpa calculation. you shouldnâ€™t be too worried about it cuz youâ€™re already two semesters ahead in math so having to retake that class next semester shouldnâ€™t affect your eligibility of getting into your engineering major as long as your gpa is decent (I think they say to aim above a 3.2 depending on the major). someone correct me if iâ€™m wrong tho
12,I had a really good experience with [https://greatapetutoring.com/](https://greatapetutoring.com/) with calc.
13,"Evan Wang is a good tutor, a bit pricy but the best I've had"
14,I emailed Toms and he had said potential functions were introduced earlier (previous week or so I can't find the email right now) so they were fair game.
15,"Grade just posted. I got a 45/100. Yikes, better rev up those fryers."
16,"You don't focus on numbers; you focus purely on the logic in a more formalized setting.

In MA 261, you have your formulas and methodologies.. run numbers through them.. boom, you have a number. Not particularly difficult.

In real analysis (and other upper division math courses), you piece together various theorems, lemmas, etc. to create a logically-sound proof that addresses the question at hand. Rote memorization will only take you so far in these courses, as opposed to in calculus/linear algebra. 

I'd suggest taking a look at baby Rudin or Bartle to get a feel for what upper division math really is."
17,"Honestly, how bad real analysis can it be? (I haven't even taken it yet)"
18,"Lesson learned, if a prof says something isn't necessary for the exam, study the shit out if it. It's not just Chen that does that."
19,Sounds like we got a repeat of Fall of 2001. Hard exams are not new at Purdue.
20,"This is so relaxing to read as a graduate. It's like watching people on Survivor going through all these insane challenges and you're chilling at home in a blanket with coco. 

But yes good luck and it'll be okay."
21,That one screwed me over for 10 minutes. I was like wtf how do I draw this shit
22,Who thought it would be a good idea to include that one volume problem that was ass-sideways.
23,"lmao same, i chose the right exam to not study for lol"
24,Good thing I didnâ€™t study sounds like it wouldâ€™ve been a futile effort
25,"Donâ€™t worry young lads, you will make it out alive. Keep working hard"
26,"But seriously what was that exam, there were like 4 questions I could sort of set up but had no idea how to solve and basically hacked my way to some super sketchy answers."
27,i was feeling so confident after studying and legit a third of the exam was stuff i hadnâ€™t seen in the practice exams
28,"I wasnâ€™t trying to throw shade at anyone.  I was just commenting that itâ€™s nice you guys can, and do, commiserate online after an exam.

Jesus."
29,This must be nice.  Back in my day you just had the long walk back to the dorm to silently loathe yourself and maybe someone on your floor to ask when they got back.  If they were a dumbass you had no gage.
30,sorry for the pain but i love these posts because they make me feel better about how bad my exam season went last week
31,right there with you homie
32,I went in feeling good since I did fairly well on the past exams. After the test I felt like I had been through one of those mortal combat finishers.
33,Curves are based off of the recitation average ( average of all your TAâ€™s recitation) you should know next recitation
34,"Look, the best advice I can give you: as long as youâ€™re above the average, youâ€™re fine. Itâ€™s really tough to gage grade cutoffs in math at Purdue, they change every year so donâ€™t bother."
35,i heard this one was the easy one :(
36,I hope that the next midterm is easy
37,I did shit. 68%. My grade dropped a whole 18% ðŸ¤¡
38,"If you didn't put the correct ID number, your exam grade will be sent to your TA a couple days later than everyone else."
39,It happens. It happened to me on one of the 261 midterms. Just pick yourself up and ace the next one out of spite.
40,"Practice being OK with not knowing how to do a particular question. Messing up one question is no big deal. Wasting time trying to fix one question and missing three easy errors elsewhere on the exam is a huge deal and is easily preventable.

IMO focusing on the *technique* of taking an exam is a lot more important than drilling the preparation in the last 24-48h. 

I guess boilerexams is cool too."
41,"Check out Liam Robinson on YouTube, aside from that, get a good night's sleep the night prior to the exam"
42,"Do every possible prob from past midterms and finals. You start to notice the problem types and patterns. Since you're are starting early enough, you can pace yourself"
43,"Holy shit dude how did I not know this website existed, it has practice exams for every single one of my classes. Thank you."
44,"I know right, I donâ€™t know why more professors donâ€™t just tell everyone to stay home and watch his lectures online, and then come to recitation with questions if they have them."
45,"You 100% did the right thing to skip calc 2, literal hellscape. I second everyoneâ€™s suggestions about dr. Chenâ€™s lectures, and SI genuinely helped a ton, Ik itâ€™s annoying to go but I promise youâ€™ll do fine if you consistently go to SI."
46,"TLDR: The only notes I usually take are formulas and general concepts. Also I often donâ€™t understand lectures the first time (even with Chenflix sometimes) but after the homework and looking at the step-by-step example I usually get it

For notes I usually just write down the main formulas/techniques for solving problems. Sometimes Iâ€™ll also include an example the professor does in case I want to refer to it later (although with recorded lectures I donâ€™t do this that much). So like Iâ€™d write what the notation for a 3D vector is and how to find the cross product, and that when the cross product is 0 the vectors are parallel and stuff like that. 

I think itâ€™s completely normal to feel a bit lost after a lecture (and thatâ€™s not just for math too); I usually only have a partial understanding of the concepts but after I do the homework it makes more sense. I might be an outlier but I kind of like MyLabMath in that for some homework questions, they show an example with step by step instructions for how to do the problem which helps tremendously with figuring out how to do stuff.

Also you absolutely did the right thing skipping Calc 2. It starts off alright but quickly becomes a lot of work and having that as your first math class would be awful. Just keep your head up, give yourself time to do the homework and learn stuff (and donâ€™t hesitate to get help when you need it), and youâ€™ll be fine."
47,Hereâ€™s the GroupMe link https://groupme.com/join_group/70101951/mrDWv1Yo hang in there youâ€™ll make it I like to redo the homework until I actually understand it because my lab math will give you different numbers for the problem each time also using the show an example on MLM is very helpful.
48,"Our lord and savior Dr. Chenâ€™s lecture videos will help tremendously. I can promise you as someone whoâ€™s taken every level of calc at Purdue, if youâ€™re struggling in 261 you would have hated your life in calc 2, and taking it wouldnâ€™t have done you any good in calc 3."
49,"I also highly recommend going to SI sessions, they do practice problems and then walk through them, it can be super helpful."
50,"https://www.math.purdue.edu/~chenjk/

Live long and prosper, bud. I promise you did the right thing by taking the credit, I felt lost in literally every semester of calc at this school."
51,I just used Kaufmann's lecture time to work on problems from past exams. MyLabMath homework would also be a good use of the time.
52,">shit

i feel u bro, its really fucking convenient for them to do that shit"
53,Bruh I have to pay $380 for online fucking platforms this semester fuck this shit fuck this shit fuck this shit
54,He frequently makes mistakes without realizing it until after the lectures and has to send out corrected notes. He isnâ€™t great at explaining basic concepts. He over complicated things and goes too into theory. He talks very fast too.
55,"I went ridiculously overboard when I took the class. Iâ€™d do all the hw for the next exam the weekend after the previous one, and do two full past exams a day from there on out. 

That amount of effort was ridiculous and mostly redundant. Donâ€™t do that. Approach exam 1 like a hard high school math exam and then tweak your studying up or down depending on how you score. 

Keep in mind that the vast majority of people only look at past exams in the 48h leading up to the exam (if my YT analytics are anything to go by) so anything more than \~2 days of dedicated studying should put you ahead of the curve."
56,What makes him a bad professor?
57,Kauffman is AWFUL do not take him if possible.
58,"ok, thanks! for the quizzes/exams, did you have to take them during recitation? or could you take them at any tune throughout the day? we have 2 recitations in a week, so would that mean 2 quizzes a week? and also, for proctors you obviously canâ€™t pick your sibling or someone to proctor you right? ðŸ˜…"
59,"I took MA 261 online last summer and remember having only one attempt for each quiz/exam. Quizzes werenâ€™t proctored and for exams you had to select a proctor that was instructor approved, Iâ€™m pretty sure they give you examples of what proctors are acceptable."
60,"Depending on your Recitation. This semester, unless you had covid or a related issue then you had to be there to take the paper recitation quiz. Paper quizes are better bc you can get partial credit. Also recitation is a good resource and generally important. Maybe reschedule your class or get a bike."
61,"Yep. If you're a couple minutes late nobody will care, just walk in and sit down quietly. If you're really pressed about it, you can let your TA know you have a class across campus right before but you really don't have to."
62,Take a close look at the grading scheme for the class.  I think they do the same thing as calc 1&2 where grades are assigned based on recitation rank.  Meaning a bad quiz score due to skipping could easily knock your grade down even if you ace the tests.  Try to switch to a different recitation.  I would think there would be dozens of them.
63,"for the spring it was not mandatory but there are quizzes most recitations so if u donâ€™t go, youâ€™ll get a 0 on the quizâ€¦I know people who were confident in there grades and didnâ€™t go to recitations but idk I would probably either change ur schedule or make the run"
64,"I took MA261 online from Oakton  last summer and didnâ€™t have to have a proctor, but that mightâ€™ve just been cause of covid so it couldâ€™ve changed. Also the class itself is very easy. A few homeworks a week, then a final that just reuses questions from the practice exam. I would definitely recommend."
65,"Thanks for the suggestions. Unfortunately, due to the way the data copy pastes over from MyLab, my spreadsheet is horrendous and I am too lazy to make it look nice. 

As for the spikes:

2/1: Homework Lesson 6, Part 1- Section 14.2 - Calculus of Vector-Valued Functions - 2 hours and 59 minutes

2/15: Homework Lesson 12- Section 15.4 - The Chain Rule - 3 hours and 51 minutes

3/7: Homework Lesson 17- Section 15.8 - Lagrange Multipliers - 2 hours and 52 minutes

3/29: Homework Lesson 27- Section 17.2 Part II, Line Integrals of Vector Fields - 2 hours and 45 minutes

4/5: Homework Lesson 29- Section 17.4 - Green's Theorem - 3 hours and 26 minutes"
66,"Great data!  This reminds me of Stephen Wolfram, the guy takes his blood pressure before and after or during things as well and then plots them."
67,"I'll be honest, I wasn't trying my hardest at that point, but like 50% of the stokes homework had a conservative field, so the answer was 0 without much effort. Also, divergence theorem made a lot of sense to me so it was pretty easy for me to pick up."
68,"I got bored again. As the semester winds down, I decided to graph the time I spent on math homework over time this semester. This time with calc 3. I averaged 1 hour and 26 minutes per homework assignment. The beginning of the graph is a little messy because we had multiple assignments for the same day (broken up across multiple sections of the book) so they were shorter than normal. This also means I actually averaged a bit more than the time stated above per homework assignment.

Good Luck on finals everyone."
69,That was so easy whatâ€™re u talking about
70,"Calc 3 is definitely rough. I take notes on every lecture (I don't go in person, I Just watch them on boilercast, I think it's easier to follow when you can speed up/slow down and pause the video). For my notes, I use three different highlighting colors, blue for definitions/terms, yellow for important information, and pink for example problems. Each lecture comes out to exactly 2 pages front and back or less. This is just the system that's works for me! For this previous test I did a 2-week study plan where I went over the notes for that day and re-did all of the homework. I never really looked at the quizzes because I feel they really don't accurately display the exam questions as well as the homework does. I took the practice exam twice, I think I got a 57% the first time, and an 85% the second time, and I got a 91% on the exam. Apart of it is definitely luck, but preparing ahead of time and doing a bunch of problems is super helpful! Good luck, you can do it :)"
71,"Ope, youâ€™re absolutely right, I have no idea why this posted here instead of there"
72,I think this comment would be better served in a Sister Cindy discussion thread instead of a thread of people trying to pass Calc 3
73,"As a math TA and tutor, I would say you need to figure out why you're not doing well. Do you know how to answer the questions but make calculation mistakes or forget formulas? Or is it more of a problem with understanding what the questions are asking or knowing how to solve them?"
74,Check out Paulâ€™s math notes for some hard examples. But for the most part itâ€™s just tons of practice
75,"When I took it last spring, they explicitly said ""all multiple choice.""

It was probably ~50% free response."
76,"You do have multiple choices, one of those choices is getting the answer correct."
77,"As long as itâ€™s not one choice, itâ€™s multiple"
78,"It's a math trick, every question is multiple choice, some just have infinite choices."
79,"For some people Calc 3 is easy, for others it really isn't. The best way I think to prepare for the class is to review vectors and conic sections. This is usually covered in the first week or so of class. I find that most people start to struggle with the class around the middle of the class with iterated integrals and most are thoroughly confused by the end. The other thing I would also say is make sure you're comfortable with trig.

If you do decide to go the private tutoring route, I'd be happy to help. PM me if you're interested."
80,Best tip with this playlist is for it to supplement your studying especially for exam practice but donâ€™t let it be your primary source for learning the material. Itâ€™s really good when you need quick practice on a skill that youâ€™re struggling with
81,"Just about done.  The number is bigger than it should be (even one is one too many) but is a very, very small population of the course.  The vast, vast majority of the students were doing the right thing."
82,"Yeah that's what chegg is for, just not during the exam. I'm assuming some people posted the problem and said something like ""how would I do this?"" And then someone replied and they used the other person's response as their test answer."
83,"Question: why would Chegg send information about who viewed the exam questions? Isnâ€™t that against guidelines? 

Also, Iâ€™m not a Chegg user I was just wondering if itâ€™s even possible for the professor to do this or if heâ€™s trying to scare people."
84,Well some people just want a piece of paper with a good GPA and the promise of good jobs that come with it. They donâ€™t care if they actually know how to do the job or not. So the motivation *does* make sense at least.
85,"Well it could be that 1) They didnâ€™t see other people get caught, 2) They didnâ€™t know about cheggs policies, and 3) their course may not have announced that they were keeping an eye on chegg. Iâ€™m not saying itâ€™s right, but they may not have been willfully ignorant to the possibility that they could get caught."
86,"Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. Just the way life is. Hopefully this is a wake up call to those people that theyâ€™re in college now."
87,"I don't think this is a case of that. I mean if you're that stupid to cheat in such an obvious manner, then that's on you"
88,"I feel like $15 is probably off by a few orders of magnitude, but yeah."
89,"This isn't my quote, but using Chegg for exams at this point is like trying to rob a police station."
90,Looks pretty manageable. Cs159 and Chem 115 are jokes. Engr 132 is fine as well. Ngl ma261 will be a grind.
91,"PSY 120 is an easy A. Itâ€™s like 30 min commitment/week seriously would recommend haha. Your course load seems manageable! I wouldnâ€™t worry about it. Iâ€™ve taken all those courses so feel free to DM if you have specific questions

Edit: I had all my research credits done by the 5th week of school because they were all online surveys"
92,Most of them were online surveys. Some of them could be pretty lengthy but they were easy. If you start doing them early on then you can be done with them pretty quick
93,I took it online and it is a very easy A.
94,"I took psy120 in person taught by George Hollich, and not only was it an easy A but it was also an incredibly fun class. I don't know if it is online or not but definitely look to take his section, in my opinion."
95,"My courses have been a shit show when it comes to brightspace. Many assignments not put in, teachers not giving an estimation of what grade youâ€™re at. Itâ€™s very frustrating. Iâ€™ve had a few profs whoâ€™ve been a god-send with the switch to brightspace though, so at least thereâ€™s that."
96,"You just need a C or above in MA 261. As for future CS classes, you only extensively use linear in CSE or ML (or another math heavy track)"
97,It does not. But it will show a little symbol ( I believe itâ€™s the letter E for exempt) next to it.
98,"Went from an 86 to a 68, so hopefully there's a fat curve for all of us to pass at the very least. Don't worry about your skill as a math student -- Purdue math is notoriously hard."
99,"Remember that the MA261 curves has been historically very generous, and even online I would not be surprised to see *some* curve:  [Purdue/MA261 at master Â· Leader-board/Purdue (github.com)](https://github.com/Leader-board/Purdue/tree/master/MA261)  \- see ""Exam grading FAQ.md"". The document was written keeping Fall 2019 in mind, but the data should help as a rough ballpark."
100,I'm in the same position as you. Was super shocked to see my final grade cause I thought I did well but apparently not. I'm PRAYING that they are super generous with the curve this semester but I really doubt that.
101,"Lmao. Since we're not allowed to discuss specifics yet, I'll say this.

I took the exam in 2 sessions (first one threw me off so bad, nothing like what I had expected) (second one went well though)

Ended up doing pretty good and securing an A.

It was not what I expected (in terms of difficulty and pattern)"
102,The calc 3 final is usually pretty bad with averages in the 40-60% range. You'll probably all be fine.
103,"If you can do integrals by hand and can do relatively simple derivatives then you should be good for the first half. The latter half of the course is more learning how to do certain theorems and when to use them and prior calc knowledge is not extremely helpful here. You can definitely take 261 and succeed and if you ever need extra assistance, there are a million resources to help with any of the topics covered in the class."
104,"As many people in this sub will tell you take MA 261. It's a really easy class with most of it just being calc 1 in 3 dimensions but you'll pick it up fast (I started school late and I took MA 261 a year after taking Calc BC at my high school). If you want a tutor for any of the Calc classes at purdue, you can pm me as well"
105,"I'm in the same situation. But I find calculus easy. From what I've read, calc 3 isn't too dependent on calc 2, so we should be good"
106,Go straight to calc 3 and save urself some misery
107,"I disagree with the other comment here because half of calc 3 is just calc 1 in three dimensions, the second half doesnt require as much prior knowledge but it is hella hard"
108,"Toms for 261 is a score. Youâ€™re good there. The beginning  and middle of the class is not at all bad, but vector calculus in the end might require you to study a lot.

I recommend switching into MA 351 with Vankoughnett. It should have open spots. Content wise, MA 351 is harder than 265 but because it is not designed for engineering students it operates on a much more forgiving grading scale. Other benefits are smaller class sizes and handwritten homework.

Canâ€™t speak on the other two classes. Good luck! :)"
109,"Having taken 351 myself personally, I find it to be easy with a professor of the same caliber as vankoughnett whereas with 265, the professors aren't as good which makes the class harder. Although there are curves in 265, based on what happened last spring where people got curved down (in 351 the curves were more generous and people didn't get curved down) which gives OP more of a risk for not getting an A."
110,"I took MA261 in the spring, am currently taking PHYS241 over the summer, and will also take MA265 and AAE203 in the fall.

I can't say for any of the professors you mentioned, but MA261 starts out very easy before reaching peak difficulty towards the last 3-4 weeks of class (vector calculus). However, like some posters may have mentioned, do make use of /u/purduecalcthree's resources, esp those exam walkthroughs on YouTube. 

PHYS241 lectures are a pain, but you will soon realize that all you need is a firm grasp of the concepts taught and knowing when/how to apply the formulas in a problem. Lectures will contain a massive amount of integrals but those don't normally show up on exams, and many HW questions do have a Help section like MyLab Math, so you should be good."
111,I personally recommend switching out MA 265 with Xuefeng Xu for MA 351 with paul vankoughnett. You got a good professor for calc (exams aren't professor dependent though) but I can't comment on the professors for your latter 2 classes
112,Thomas Cunningham is a great Professor in my personal opinion. He is good at taking things slowly and making sure heâ€™s focusing on the topics that his students donâ€™t understand rather than just rushing through to get through the lecture.
113,MA 265 is relatively easy as far as a Purdue math class goes. AAE 203 is also one of the easier Aerospace Curriculum classes as far as I know. I've heard PHYS 241 is alright now but MA 261 was a pain for me. Overall though just 4 classes shouldn't be too bad if you can manage you time anyway. Good luck.
114,"Thank you so much!! Also, MA261 remains the exact same course whether taken in the fall or summer right? Just asking because there was a fall 2018 link and summer 2020 for the same course"
115,"I understand where you are coming from, but personally I found that this is a better approach considering the length of my post (which would otherwise be too long as a comment). 

That being said, the moderators are free to delete this if they think that this post is unsuitable. I only did this in good faith and apologise if I've made a mistake in any way."
116,"My advisor told me.  You can also use this link to see which courses transfer  [https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwtxcrd.p\_select\_info](https://selfservice.mypurdue.purdue.edu/prod/bzwtxcrd.p_select_info) .

One of my friends told me that she is taking MA261 at Ivy Tech to transfer credits so I'm confused. This is my first time looking for summer courses at cc so I don't really know how and where to look for stuff lmk if you find something different"
117,Taking it right now at Oakton CC. It uses the same textbook and mymathlab as purdue but there aren't any lectures. Luckily you can mostly just watch Chen's lectures.
118,"You see, I need a 46 or higher to pass the class and I havenâ€™t taken the final yet.

You donâ€™t understand how f*cked I feel right now"
119,"That by itself won't do you much ([Fall 2019 for C- was \~55%](https://github.com/Leader-board/Purdue/blob/master/MA261/Exam%20grading%20FAQ.md)). The nice thing is that you have a *defined* cutoff, that is you are sure of getting that grade if you can attain the minimum, no matter whatever happens. This is also a case where having a 'easier' recitation can only help you (even if's slight)."
120,"depends on your situation whether you're a Math/Engineering or any other science major.   
B is indeed a good grade..."
121,"Considering that some people have surely failed (given the way they grade the class), yes, a B is very good."
122,Thank you! My ta gave out pretty hard quizzes with near 50% averages so Iâ€™m praying to god I at least get a B- lol
123,"Yeah, no problem.

A+ - 502

A   - 470

A-  - 439

B+  - 421

B    - 397

B-   - 379

C+  - 348

C    - 382   \* Probably 332 but that's what it says

C-   - 310

D+  - 278

D    -263

Looks like you about a A- ."
124,"My TA sent out a rough estimate of the cut-offs.

Based on your scores you have a C+ or B-!"
125,I think the 261 final average was super low based on what Iâ€™ve seen on reddit.
126,If you donâ€™t get an A- with that than Iâ€™m fucked
127,"When I took the class, there wasnâ€™t a big one. I remember doing kinda meh on the final when I had done relatively well on all the midterms and I still got a C+. BUT DONâ€™T GET SCARED. It changes all the time.

TLDR, just do your best. The professors probably donâ€™t even know what the curve is right now."
128,At this point just study hard and wait two weeks for final grades to come out
