</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Globalization is a very popular topic, resulting in
 a lot of loose and poorly thought-through talk and writing around the 
subject. The view taken in this course is that to understand current 
processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and 
amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this 
course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization.
 China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the 
challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. 
For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous 
impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical 
juncture as the "century of shame." Towards the end of the 20th century 
and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of 
globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, 
transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's 
second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading 
some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! Typically 
offered Fall Spring Summer.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The main goal of this seminar is to guide graduate 
students when preparing their Ph.D. dissertation proposals. The seminar 
aims to do two things. The first is to provide an overview of the 
crucial research design tools and research planning considerations that 
can help students plan and carry out better dissertation projects. The 
second is to offer a structured forum where students can present and 
receive feedback on their dissertation proposals. With permission from 
the Director of Graduate Studies, this course may be repeated and used 
to support the development of a grant proposal or research publication.
