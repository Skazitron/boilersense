expand student's basic algebraic skills and problem-solving capabilities
 and to prepare them for higher level mathematics courses.  For the 
purposes of general education requirements, Math 115 is not a collegiate
 level mathematics course, and therefore cannot be used to satisfy the 
general education requirement for mathematics at Purdue University
