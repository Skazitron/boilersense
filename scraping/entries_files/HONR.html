Credit Hours: 3.00.  The Research Mentorship Development Program is 
designed for Purdue based on a nationally recognized curriculum and 
prepares graduate students or postdocs to mentor undergraduates in 
research. Effective mentoring of undergraduate researchers requires 
specific skillsets and approaches. Implementation of these strategies 
can lead to a productive and mutually beneficial experience for both 
students and their mentors. The course is designed for graduate students
 who plan to work with new researchers in their labs or research groups 
and who plan to enter academia or pursue careers in which they will 
mentor others in scholarship or research. Graduate students or postdocs 
selected for the program are matched with honors students who are 
interested in research. Permission of department required.
