1.  Develop the theory and knowledge that actuarial students need to 
apply basic life contingencies to more sophisticated and complicated 
models. 
2.  Calculate expected values, variances, and other moments for 
situations involving multiple decrements, joint and survivor life 
functions, pension plans, and other insurance products.
3.  Determine the distributions of losses for these situations and use 
those distributions to calculate premiums, reserves, and capital needs. 
4.  Use statistical models to determine the premiums necessary using 
standard profit testing techniques.
5.  Analyze the expected profit for each year and determine the source 
of profit within each year.

Credit Hours:  3.00.  This material provides an introduction to modeling
 and covers important actuarial methods that are useful in modeling. 
Students will be introduced to survival, severity, frequency and 
aggregate models, and use statistical methods to estimate parameters of 
such models given sample data. The student will further learn to 
identify steps in the modeling process, understand the underlying 
assumptions implicit in each family of models, recognize which 
assumptions are applicable in a given business application, and 
appropriately adjust the models for impact of insurance coverage 
modifications. The student will be introduced to a variety of tools for 
the calibration and evaluation of the models. Permission of instructor

Credit Hours: 3.00.  As a sequel to STAT 52500, this course introduces 
some statistical modeling tools that are developed for situations where 
least squares regression and standard ANOVA techniques may not naturally
 apply. One coverage centers around two lines of models that are closely
 related, the generalized linear models (GLM) for regression (and ANOVA)
 with non Gaussian responses, and survival models for the analysis of 
lifetime data. Among issues to be discussed are the estimation of the 
models, the testing of hypotheses, and the checking of model adequacy. 
Data examples will be used throughout the course to illustrate the 
methodologies and the related software tools in R.  Typically offered 
Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.&nbsp; This course provides a thorough introduction 
to the R programming language, and its use for statistical computing and
 data science. The course will first look at the fundamentals of R, 
including different data-structures, control-flow, and the basic 
vocabulary. An emphasis will be placed on learning idiomatic and 
efficient R, covering ideas such as recycling, vectorization and 
functional programming. The course will then look at principles and 
tools for tasks like organizing data (‘tidy data’), manipulating data 
(‘data carpentry’), querying data (through topics like regular 
expressions) as well as visualizing data (including interactive 
visualizations). The material and the homework will encourage 
development of modular reusable code and reproducible research through 
ideas such as object-oriented programming and dynamic documents in R 
Markdown. The last part of the course will study statistical procedures 
such as least-squares regression, LASSO, Monte Carlo sampling and Markov
 chain Monte Carlo. Besides exams and homeworks, the course will involve
 a final project that students can collaborate together on.

Credit Hours: 3.00.&nbsp; Bayesian data analysis refers to practical 
inferential methods that use probability models for both observable and 
unobservable quantities. The flexibility and generality of these methods
 allow them to address complex real-life problems that are not amenable 
to other techniques. This course will provide a pragmatic introduction 
to Bayesian data analysis and its powerful applications. Topics include:
 the fundamentals of Bayesian inference for single and multiparameter 
models, regression, hierarchical models, model checking, approximation 
of a posterior distribution by iterative and non-iterative sampling 
methods, and Bayesian nonparametrics. Specific topics and the course 
outline are subject to change as the semester progresses. All topics 
will be motivated by problems from the physical, life, social, and 
management sciences. Conceptual understanding and inference via computer
 simulation will be emphasized throughout the course. Permission of

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course introduces the basic concepts and 
methods of applied statistics in all areas of science and engineering. 
Three distinctive features of this honors course are: (1) self-learning 
and discovery of concepts and methods of statistical analysis through 
guided instructions, literature search, derivation and simulation; (2) 
classroom participation - both individually and collaboratively - in 
active learning of difficult concepts; and (3) communicating such 
learning to general readers. Students will acquire a basic competence in
 using statistical freeware R, in presenting data visually, in analyzing
 data appropriately, in interpreting the results in the context of 
research problems, and in communicating findings in plain but impactful 
language to readers not trained in Statistics. STAT-S351 extends all 
material covered in STAT 35000 to a deeper level, and gives glimpses 
into some methodologies delegated to advanced courses, thereby 
motivating and preparing students to take advanced undergraduate 
statistics courses. Typically offered Fall Spring.
