Credit Hours: 3.00.  Every day, every one of us makes choices and 
engages in social interactions, including exchange. We do this within a 
context of institutions formal rules and informal norms that shape our 
incentives. The outcomes that emerge, and the value we create in the 
process, depends on those institutions and incentives. Economics is a 
broad and diverse body of ideas that helps us understand those everyday 
choices and the kinds of outcomes they generate. We will explore these 
economic ideas and the ways that institutions affect outcomes, from 
informal social norms all the way to big questions of social 
organization such as the contrast between capitalism and socialism. Our 
main method of exploring economic ideas will be communicating those 
ideas through writing, video, and other multimedia approaches; we will 
build and deepen our understanding of economic ideas in society by 
explaining them, applying them, and sharing them with others. Course 
readings will include work by some of the most eloquent and effective 
economics communicators over the past 250 years up to today.

concepts in statistics needed for further study of econometrics and 
provide basic preparation for ECON 36000. Topics include the 
organization, analysis, and interpretation of data; descriptive 
statistics; probability theory; sampling distributions; inference and 
hypothesis testing; and simple linear regression analysis. The approach 
of the class includes both learning the concepts behind basic statistics
 and also how to apply these concepts to make data-informed, real-world 
economic decisions. Students will become familiar with the common 
statistical techniques and databases for analyzing data by using both 
hand-calculations and STATA to analyze data.

 divided into two broad categories - fuels (oil and natural gas) and 
electricity - and across three different areas of applied microeconomic 
theory: competition policy, regulatory policy, and environmental policy.
 We will analyze economic regulation in both fuels and electricity, 
developing the economic theory of regulation and exploring how 
regulation affects the decisions and behavior of regulated firms 
differently in the two different types of energy industries. We will 
also develop economic models to analyze the environmental consequences 
of energy use.

the rules by which firms are supposed to compete. Regulations may 
require that firms obtain approval to set prices, change prices, or 
enter new markets. They may require firms to adhere to environmental or

 will analyze health and health care theories, institutions, and key

course begins with an analysis of health care as a commodity and why 
health is different from other consumer goods. The course then examines 
the demand for and the production of health and health care, and the 
behavior and organization of health care providers. The discussion then 
switches to information asymmetries and the functioning of health 
insurance markets. Afterwards, the course turns to the analysis of 
government involvement in the health care system. The class concludes 
with an examination of medical care systems around the world, paying 
particular attention to the U.S. health care system.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  It has become increasingly clear to economists, 
legal scholars and political scientists that it is impossible to 
understand economic institutions without first having an understanding 
of the legal framework within which they operate. Similarly, it is 
impossible to understand the impact of law on society without first 
having an understanding of economic principles. This problem is further 
complicated by the fact that there are often ambiguities in the written 
law that lead to significant differences between what the law appears to
 say and how the law is interpreted in the courts. This course is 
designed to give the student an understanding of both legal and economic
 principles and the relationship between them. Finally, through the use 
of economic analysis, the student will acquire the tools to predict the 
likely outcomes of particular laws and how they will affect their family
 and business decisions.

by two or more players where any player's action has an impact on other 
player's payoff. Players are decision making units, e.g. individuals, 
firms, workers, managers, countries etc. Game theory analyzes situations
 in which people (or other animals) interact by breaking these 
situations down into basic descriptions of the set of players, the 
strategies available to these players, and the payoffs that the players

rigorous understanding of the linear regression model, its 
representation and assumptions, procedures for estimation and properties
 associated with the OLS estimator. We move on and apply what we have 
learned to the linear regression model. We discuss estimation and

consistency and convergence in mean square. We conclude by considering a
 few nonlinear models appropriate for modeling binary outcomes.

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.&nbsp; This course examines topics in 
empirical industrial organization (I.O.), which aims to use data to draw
 conclusions about how market and firm structure, firm conduct, and 
market performance interact in imperfectly competitive markets. We will 
take a "structural" approach, focusing on estimating the parameters of 
game theoretic models using real industry data, and then simulating 
those same models to generate predictions under alternative 
("counterfactual") scenarios. We will cover theory only to the extent 
that it provides intuition or testable conclusions. The course is 
divided into two unequal parts. In the first part, we will learn about 
static games in the context of mergers, market power, and entry. In the 
second part, we will focus on the estimation of dynamic games, after 
first understanding how to solve and estimate dynamic single-agent 
problems. Pre-requisites: ECON 62000 and ECON 62100.

 Generally, we first review benchmark models of trade that explain basic
 facts in international trade. Our focus remains on unifying these 
theories as well as learning tools to bring the theories to data to 
conduct policy and welfare analysis. Material is selected from current 
journal articles. Throughout the course, we study several applications 
including the impact of tariffs and trade agreements, the interaction 
between trade and labor market, the interaction between trade and 
environment, economic geography and the impact of spatial policies, and 
agricultural production and trade in the global economy.

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  In this course, we will examine some of the
 basic elements of Game Theory. Game Theory studies strategic 
environments in which each individual's payoff depends upon both their 
own actions as well as the actions of others. Game Theory attempts to 
develop an understanding of such situations and to provide a formal 
framework and solution concepts for making better strategic choices.
