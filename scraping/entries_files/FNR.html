Landscape ecology focuses on the important relationships of landscape 
structure (pattern, heterogeneity) and ecological processes (movement of
 animals, hydrologic dynamics) and how this information is used for 
natural resource management. Biogeography examines ecological patterns 
and processes at larger scales (generally at subcontinental to global) 
for the purposes of managing plants and animals of global importance. In
 the last 15 years, tremendous efforts have been made to create spatial 
databases that help support research and management of natural resources
 at various scales. The lab will focus on the use and application of 
these databases that are common in natural resource management settings.
