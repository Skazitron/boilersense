properties of the enzyme throughout the semester. Emphasis will be 
placed on quantitative analyses, including measurements of enzyme 
activity and inhibition, molecular interactions, and oligomeric state. 
Students will learn basic principles of designing assays to measure 
biochemical phenomena. Use of bioinformatics and computational modeling 
tools for protein structure analysis will be integrated. The course will

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides a hands-on experience for life
 science researchers in the bioinformatic analysis of genome-scale data.
 The various disciplines in the life sciences are generating a wealth of
 experimental and annotation data. Today's graduate students need 
experience with modern tools that can help them to access, explore, 
analyze, interpret and manage the data that they generate in the lab. 
Students will use the R programming language and packages from 
Bioconductor, the R bioinformatics project, as their principal tools for
 this course. Students will develop workflows in R that bridge 
established algorithms for bioinformatics such as limma, edgeR or 
DESeq2, incorporating methods to import, QC, transform and visualize 
genome-scale datasets derived from next generation sequencing 
experiments.  A critical aspect of bioinformatics that is often 
inadequate is workflow documentation. This course will use Rmarkdown to 
integrate computer code,  data and results to manage complex 
bioinformatics projects. The class has lecture, lab and distance 
components. Lectures will focus on the theoretical and biological 
aspects of bioinformatics analysis using recent examples from the 
literature. In lab, students will work on programming exercises or 
projects using published datasets. Advanced students will also have the 
opportunity to work with their own data. Distance instruction will 
include R tutorials and videos that students can work through at their 
own pace (subject to completion deadlines).  Particular emphasis will be
 placed on the theoretical and practical limitations of next generation 
sequencing data. No prior computer programming experience is required, 
but it is assumed that students have a firm grasp of the fundamental 
principles of molecular biology and how they relate to complex processes
 such as gene expression and genome organization. Permission of 
instructor required.
