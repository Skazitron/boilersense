1.  Model belt, chain and gear drives and identify the type of loading 
existing in a power transmission system due to the integration of each 
type of drive and specify suitable types and sizes of belts and heaves, 
chains and sprockets, and gear train characteristics to transmit a given
 level of power at specified speeds for the input and output shafts.
2.  Compute the torques and forces exerted on shafts by couplings, 
bearings, belt, chain and gear drives by utilizing torque diagrams and 
load, shear and moment diagrams in two orthogonal planes and use the 
modified 1927 shaft standard equation as proposed by Krutzet al to 
specify diameter of a shaft exposed to torsional and/or bending moment 
loads.
3.  Categorize examples of mechanical systems based upon the type of 
component loading existing in the system.
4.  Identify various types of rolling bearings, the mounting techniques 
used with roller bearings and the interference fits required, determine 
total bearing reactions to due to component loading and assess basic 
static and dynamic load ratings and life rating for various types of 
bearings.
5.  Compute the forces exerted on gear teeth as they rotate and transmit
 power and use appropriate stress analysis to determine relationships 
among applied forces, the geometry of gear teeth, and other specified 
factors necessary to specify gear parameters including diametrical 
pitch, number of teeth, tooth width etc., required for various 
applications.
6.  Introduce relationship between polar moment of inertia and mass 
moment of inertia for solid cylindrical shafts so that the design of a 
power transmission system may encompass speed of response of the system.
7.  Integrate the mechanical concepts necessary to complete a 
preliminary design of a conveyor system.
8.  Install and align a variety of bearings, shafts, couplings, belt, 
chain and gear drives using laboratory equipment provided and measure 
and adjust belt tension, chain sag and gear backlash and experimentally 
verify theoretical relationships governing the speed ratio of belt, 
chain and gear drives.
