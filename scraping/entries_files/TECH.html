<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00. Innovating in our complex world requires 
understanding people and the issues and challenges they face. This 
unique course brings together perspectives from technology and 
anthropology to address this by exploring ethnographic studies of people
 and technology interactions. Through this process, students will 
practice the problem scoping skills necessary to identify and define 
problems and begin to generate appropriate design solutions. In 
addition, students will learn how to observe and talk with people about 
technology and discuss a range of ways people use&nbsp;technology. 
Accordingly, the course will focus on human-centered design and how to 
empathize will people during the design process. This will allow 
students to learn how to identify opportunities for innovation that 
emerge when designers carefully observe and listen to humans using 
technology and/or experiencing problems with current technology. Note: 
This class engages the material in both the classroom and innovation 
labs.

Credit Hours: 3.00. Innovating in our complex world requires us to think
 strategically and make the best decisions possible for both designing 
and business development. Accordingly, this unique course brings 
together perspectives from technology and business management to 
iteratively prototype innovative solutions to student-selected problems.
 This process will include creating prototypes in a variety of media, 
using the appropriate methods/tools, as well as exploring the processes 
and biases related to how people process information and make decisions.
 This type of work will help to guide the innovation process by gaining 
insights from testing prototypes and interacting with people to deepen 
one’s understanding of customer needs, market segments, costs of goods, 
competitor operations, and market strategies. At the conclusion of the 
course, students will pitch a viable design solution and business model 
for a validated problem to a variety of potential investors and/or 
stakeholders. Note: This class engages the material in both the

 Environment. Energy audits, energy economics, metering, performance 
contracting and financing with demand response, measurement, 
verification, equipment applications, and systems will be studied. An 
overview of alternative energy as well as the latest energy efficient 
lighting technology will be given. The quantitative analysis of water, 
air gas electricity and steam (WAGES) will be given. This course 
presents the key concepts and methods of energy efficiency. It explores 
how energy is converted into useful services and the role of increased 
efficiency in providing those services with less energy. The different 
forms of efficiency improvements and conservation are introduced, 
drawing upon examples in transportation, buildings, and industry. Case 
studies of energy auditing, energy purchasing and conservation, 
maintenance and operation issues, code and standards applied in energy 
resource management will be given. Graduate student status or senior
