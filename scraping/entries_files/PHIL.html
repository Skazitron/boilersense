<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course is designed for all philosophy majors, 
but is open to anyone interested in minor/majoring in philosophy. The 
format for this course is based on three components: reading and 
reflection, along with in-class discussion; in-class guest speakers who 
will address various topics in philosophy as a field, and/or 
professionalization (both within and outside of academia); and short 
written exercises, often done in class, which are designed to build up 
to the final project. Most classes will begin with a guest speaker 
giving a brief introduction to a particular area or topic within 
philosophy. Students will have a short reading assigned for each class 
period that will be discussed with the instructor following the guest's 
presentation. The course readings will be, as best as possible, related 
to the area/topic introduced by the guest. Certain classes will be 
dedicated solely to career/professionalization interests and will 
feature guests with expertise in these areas. The professionalization 
experts will help students develop their career goals, identify possible
 internships and scholarships to pursue while a student at Purdue, and 
develop career goals for after they have graduated. Finally, certain 
classes will be dedicated to writing and the development of the final 
project, which will include a proposed 8-semester path of study, a 
polished resume/CV, and career/professionalization goals. Typically 
offered Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course, we will survey the classic works of
 classical Chinese philosophy (c. 600-200 BCE). We will focus on seven 
major philosophers (and their followers): Kongzi (Confucius), Mozi, 
Mengzi (Mencius), Zhuangzi, Laozi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi. We will use 
their work to consider topics such as: the nature and value of morality,
 the proper role of ritual in human life, whether human nature is good 
or bad, how one becomes a moral person, the proper role and function of 
government, and more. In addition to introducing the competing 
traditions of Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism, the course 
will help students to develop basic philosophical skills as they develop
 and defend their own views on these topics. No knowledge of Chinese is 
expected. Typically offered Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Repeatable twice for a maximum of 9 credits. 
Academic philosophy demands both the ability to read large amounts of 
texts fluently, carefully, and closely. Furthermore, the abstract nature
 of philosophical discourse places a large cognitive demand upon 
readers. This course prepares non-native English speakers philosophy 
students for these intensive reading demands. The course has three major
 learning areas:  the language skills that students need to read 
fluently (i.e., the efficient processing of language for general 
comprehension of meaning); reading strategies that students can use to 
improve comprehension and learning; and communication about readings, as
 the close reading of texts is essential to communicating one's ideas 
both orally and in writing. Students are also supported in their regular
 philosophy courses. This course is linked to one or more 500+ level 
philosophy seminars that students in this course are enrolled in. 
Reading materials, writing activities, and projects for the course are 
designed to complement tasks and projects required in the linked

Writing on a higher academic level can be especially challenging for 
non-native English-writers. Thus, this course aims to develop students' 
graduate-level skillsets in philosophical practices in an English 
language environment to help them gain confidence and become productive

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Applied ethics (Ethics and the Law) involve the 
practical application of the rules of professional conduct of lawyers 
and how these rules apply to the everyday practice of the legal 
profession.  We will also examine the canons of judicial conduct, which 
are the standards of conduct for judges.  How do these standards of 
conduct for lawyers and judges protect the general public by the 
policing of the legal profession and the administering of justice in our
 courts - or do these rules, in reality, protect the general public?  As
 the calendar permits, we will also look at the rule of admission (to 
the bar) and disciplining of lawyers.  Upon scrutiny, we'll attempt to 
answer the question of whether these rules and canons really work or are
 they simple "window dressing" for a profession and system in need of 
uplifting in the eyes of the general public?  Additional readings and 
studies might include the rules of small claims courts in Indiana, and 
time permitting, such study will include scenarios of ethics regarding 
the administration of justice and litigation involving landlords and 
tenants (a common small claims subject of litigation).Additional 
subjects which may be reviewed relate to patients' rights under the 
"patients' Bill of Rights" as such codes and statements are related to 
medical ethics.  Included in this subject would be the "Pediatric Bill 
of Rights," "Codes of Specialty Healthcare Associations" and patients' 
rights as they are afforded by the "Regulations for Skilled Nursing 
Facilities.". Typically offered Fall Summer Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00. The purpose of this course is to explore the

what ethical obligations human begins have toward the environment. In 
the first half of the course we’ll survey the history environmental 
ethics and various theories that have been created in response to the 
central question of what (if any) parts of nature have moral status. 
We’ll evaluate whether the environment has ethical value because it is 
useful to human beings or because it is valuable in its own right. In 
doing this we’ll look at theories that can be used to evaluate what 
ethical obligations you might have to plants, animals, ecosystems, and 
the natural world as a whole. In the second half of the course we’ll 
narrow in on some specific topics within environmental ethics which 
might include wilderness preservation, population, the ethics of food, 
the relationship between technology and nature and the role of 
government in setting environmental ethics policies. Typically offered

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course we will examine the basic concepts 
of early Buddhist philosophy and their subsequent development in various
 Buddhist schools. Although the Three Refuges - The Buddha, the Dharma 
(teaching), and the Sangha (Buddhist community) serve the common 
foundation for all Buddhist traditions, we will focus primarily on the 
Dharma.  Specifically, we will examine its philosophical development and
 interpretation in the Theravadin Abhidharma; the Mahayanan 
Prajnaparamita and the Ch'an/Zin traditions; and the Vajrayana of Tibet.
  And finally we will explore some of the practical applications and 
implications of the Buddhist theory of impermanence and interdependence 
for the contemporary obsession with the ownership and consumption of 
goods.  In so doing, we will ponder the Buddha's observation that: 
"Contentment is the greatest wealth."

Mencius and Hsun-tzu, in contrast to Legalism, Taoism and the School of 
Mo-tzu.  From Taoism we will study the writings of Leo-tzu, Chuang-tzu 
and other Taoist and Neo-Taoist philosophers.  Taoism in synthesis with 
Buddhism yields Ch/an (Zen).  We will explore Taoist/Buddhist dialectic 
in the evolution of Zen.  The synthesis of Ch¿an and Taoism with 
Confucianism yields Neo-Confucianism.  We will study the process of 
integrating the Buddhist/Taoist synthesis into Confucianism 
philosophical understanding as we read from the Neo-Confucian sources.

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will span several topics in classical 
philosophical theology.  We will begin by considering the implications 
of the very idea of God as an absolutely perfect being, noting various 
puzzles to which this idea gives rise and surveying main responses to 
those puzzles.  We will then consider at some length a popular form of 
argument against the existence of God, so-conceived (the argument from 
evil) and a popular form of argument in favor of God's existence (the 
argument from design).  Near the end of the course, we will consider a 
range of perspectives - some friendly to religious belief and some 
unfriendly - on the relationship of religious faith and reason.  Our 
topics are the subject of much recent philosophical writing, and our 
readings will draw from a wide array of contribitors to this 
contemporary discussion. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
