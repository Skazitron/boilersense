program participants are undergraduate students, who work part-time 
(more than 11 hours per week and less than 30 hours per week) in paid 
positions during the academic year terms (fall and spring semesters) for
 an employer with a local business or office. During the summer term, 
Parallel Co-Op students work in part-time or full-time positions at any 
location offered by the employer.  A minimum of a one-year commitment is
 required for Parallel Co-Op students and employers. During the academic
 year, Parallel Co-Op students register for 6 to 11 credit hours of 
academic course load, and also for an appropriate 0-credit hour Parallel
 Co-Op course that carries half-time student status to recognize the 
academic impact of the experience. The combination of both academic 
courses and Parallel Co-Op course registrations provides students with 
full-time status. During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students 
register for a zero-credit hour Parallel Co-Op Summer course that

Credit Hours: 0.00.  Cooperative Education (Co-Op) is an academic 
program with oversight provided by assigned Faculty Coordinators who 
serve as the Instructor for participating students. Parallel Co-Op 
program participants are undergraduate students, who work part-time 
(more than 11 hours per week and less than 30 hours per week) in paid 
positions during the academic year terms (fall and spring semesters) for
 an employer with a local business or office. During the summer term, 
Parallel Co-Op students work in part-time or full-time positions at any 
location offered by the employer.  A minimum of a one-year commitment is
 required for Parallel Co-Op students and employers. During the academic
 year, Parallel Co-Op students register for 6 to 11 credit hours of 
academic course load, and also for an appropriate 0-credit hour Parallel
 Co-Op course that carries half-time student status to recognize the 
academic impact of the experience. The combination of both academic 
courses and Parallel Co-Op course registrations provides students with 
full-time status.  During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students 
register for a zero-credit hour Parallel Co-Op Summer course that 
carries full-time student status. Permission of Instructor required.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 0.00.  Cooperative Education (Co-Op) is an academic 
program with oversight provided by assigned Faculty Coordinators who 
serve as the Instructor for participating students. Parallel Co-Op 
program participants are undergraduate students, who work part-time 
(more than 11 hours per week and less than 30 hours per week) in paid 
positions during the academic year terms (fall and spring semesters) for
 an employer with a local business or office. During the summer term, 
Parallel Co-Op students work in part-time or full-time positions at any 
location offered by the employer.  A minimum of a one-year commitment is
 required for Parallel Co-Op students and employers. During the academic
 year, Parallel Co-Op students register for 6 to 11 credit hours of 
academic course load, and also for an appropriate 0-credit hour Parallel
 Co-Op course that carries half-time student status to recognize the 
academic impact of the experience. The combination of both academic 
courses and Parallel Co-Op course registrations provides students with 
full-time status. During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students 
register for a zero-credit hour Parallel Co-Op Summer course that 
carries full-time student status. Permission of Instructor required.

and things in other places - also writing about how to travel, when to 
travel, and advice on traveling - all with the reader in mind. It's 
about relaying your travel experiences to others so that they may 
emulate them or at the very least not make the same mistakes you did. 
And it's writing about things in your own back yard that are exotic to 
everyone else - a local farmer's market, historic site, restaurant,

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Over the last decade, the field of strategic 
communication has grown rapidly. The work of strategic communication 
professionals requires coordinated responses between distinct 
organizational units that are often separated by time and space. These 
conditions necessitate effective leadership. Further complicating 
leadership in these contexts is the fact that the work of strategic 
communication has increasingly become global in nature. This course 
provides students with theoretical background in leadership and global 
strategic communication, as well as the opportunity to apply what they 
learn to strategic communication cases and to their own professional 
experiences. It also encourages them to think proactively about 
leadership challenges in these contexts and to articulate
