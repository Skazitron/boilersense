Credit Hours: 3.00.  Real-time systems are hardware/software systems in 
which a timely response by a computer to external stimuli is vital to 
the performance of the system's objectives. This is the study of 
temporal determinism. Embedded systems are those with special-purpose 
microcomputers designed into the system for explicit purposes. Examples 
of such are the computers on your car's engine that control fuel 
injection, fly-by-wire altitude controls in modern jet aircraft, even 
the microcontroller inside a cellular phone. In these examples, the 
computer has a specific, limited task that is part of the functionality 
of the device and specifying average performance of that computer is 
insufficient for successful completion of the task at hand. Imagine if 
the flight controls of a Boeing 787 on final landing approach experience
 a "network lag" similar to that which occurs occasionally while you're 
reading e-mail. If the controls stop responding at a critical time, a 
horrific crash could occur. Even if the system doesn't freeze up 99.99% 
of the time, it can still result in disaster.
