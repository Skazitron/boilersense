1.   Understand the capabilities and use of integrated crop management 
digital data software packages (e.g. ENCIRCA from Dupont Pioneer or 
FieldView from Climate Corporation) to organize, analyze and interpret 
multiple layers and sources of geo-referenced data to correctly 
prescribe agronomic crop inputs and input levels.
2.  Identify primary limitations within field zones and uniquely manage 
corn and soybean crops by zone-specific prescriptions.
3.  Utilize data-based soil sampling strategies to manage soil fertility
 (primarily P, K, pH) on a site-specific basis.
4.  Make cost-effective, environmentally-sound N fertility management 
recommendations for corn utilizing soil, genetic, agronomic and economic
 data, software crop models, temperature and precipitation data and 
sensors as tools for N management.
5.  Write site-specific prescriptions for genetic (i.e. corn hybrid and 
soybean cultivar) placement and seeding rates.
6.  Utilize geo-referenced field scouting data and crop models to 
prescribe effective pest management strategies.
7. Acquire, analyze and utilize, geo-referenced crop data from multiple 
sources including spectral reflectance, grain harvest yield maps 
(calibrated and cleaned), real-time sensor readings of soil organic 
matter, moisture and temperature at planting (e.g. SmartFirmer), soil 
conductivity, SSURGO and other geo-referenced soils map resources.
8.  Explain the capabilities and utility of auto-steer, section control,
 and variable rate control crop production technologies.   
9.  Use yield maps plus as-applied site-specific crop input (e.g. N, P, 
K, ag lime, herbicide, hybrid, variety, seeding rate, fungicide and 
yield map layers as analytical tools to assess possible yield and 
profit-limiting factors
10.  Evaluate potential crop response to varying input level main 
effects and input interactions with other yield-influencing factors 
(e.g. soil type X corn hybrid or soil type X corn hybrid X N rate 
interactions).
11.  Describe and explain the impact of productivity influencing soils 
factors (e.g. soil drainage system design and installation, cover crops 
and crop residue management).
12.  Describe the use of precision technologies in the management of 
irrigation (e.g. capacitance probe soil moisture sensing and crop 
modeling software) strategies.
 13.  Prepare and deliver a professional extension or industry education
 agronomic presentation covering an aspect of Precision Crop Management.
