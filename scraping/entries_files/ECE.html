 Fundamentals I. The course addresses mathematical and computational 
foundations of circuit analysis (differential equations, Laplace 
Transform techniques) with a focus on application to linear circuits 
having variable behavior as a function of frequency, with emphasis on 
filtering. Variable frequency behavior is further considered for 
applications of electronic components through single-transistor and 
operational amplifiers. The course ends with consideration of how 
circuits behave and may be modeled for analysis at high frequencies.

Credit Hours: 1.00 or 2.00.  This course provides an opportunity for 
undergraduate students to explore and develop comprehensive applications
 of electrical and computer engineering technologies, especially as they
 relate to active research areas of Purdue faculty members. Students 
will learn about the underlying research, and will work on teams to 
formulate applications of the research that address real-world needs. 
Students will attend a weekly lecture that provides an introduction to a
 broad range of applicable technologies and development tools - some 
associated with the activities of specific teams, and some addressing 
topics of more general value to students enrolled in the course.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (CSCI 36300) This course is designed to teach 
students best practices in designing and implementing object-oriented 
systems of high quality. To accomplish this task, we start with an 
overview of software design patterns and their role in developing 
high-quality software. We then begin surveying different design-level 
software design patterns, such as the Bridge, Strategy, Wrapper Facade, 
and Visitor software design patterns. Next, we touch on software design 
patterns for building distributed systems. Finally, we finish the course
 by surveying software anti-patterns, which are common design mistakes 
that negatively impact system quality, such as degrading performance as 
the system scales in size and complexity. Students will have the 
opportunity to apply learned techniques on several programming projects 
throughout the semester.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Lecture sessions provide the student with 
background information on the design and management of projects. Formal 
lectures cover, for example, design for manufacturability, design for 
quality, test and evaluation, reliability and ethics, patents and 
copyrights, plus case studies. During the laboratory sessions, the 
students work in teams on a challenging open-ended electrical 
engineering project that draws on previous coursework. Projects 
routinely involve standard design facets (such as consideration of 
alternative solutions, feasibility considerations, and detailed system 
descriptions) and include a number of realistic constraints (such as 
cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics). Completion of BS EE or BS 
CmpE core curriculum.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is a graduate-level introduction to 
information theory. Information theory is probably the most elegant 
mathematical theories, with the most direct and significant engineering 
impacts to our life in the information age. Information theory has found
 its applications in many areas, including statistics, computer 
sciences, biology, economics, etc. The focus of this course will be on 
the direct application of information theory in digital communications. 
We believe that the most important part of learning information theory 
is to learn a new way of thinking about engineering problems. In this 
sense, this course is beneficial not only to communication majored 
students, but also to students in other engineering disciplines. 
Prerequisites: a basic course in probability/statistics.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The modern smartphone is enabled by a billion-plus 
nano-transistors, each having an active region that is barely a few 
hundred atoms long. Interestingly the same amazing technology has also 
led to a deeper understanding of the nature of current flow on an atomic
 scale. The aim of this course is to make the fundamentals of 
nanoelectronics accessible to anyone in any branch of science or 
engineering, assuming very little background beyond linear algebra and 
differential equations, although we will be discussing advanced concepts
 in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics that should be of interest 
even to specialists. We first introduce a new perspective connecting the
 quantized conductance of short ballistic conductors to the familiar 
Ohm's  law of long diffusive conductors, along with a brief description 
of the modern nano-transistor. We then address fundamental conceptual 
issues related to the meaning of resistance on an atomic scale, the 
interconversion of electricity and heat, the second law of 
thermodynamics and the fuel value of information. Finally we introduce 
the concepts of quantum transport as applied to modern nanoscale 
electronic devices.

 a proper grounding in the basic concepts and seminal work in computer 
network protocols and systems, and to introduce students to research in 
the field. The course will cover classical concepts such as network 
architecture, switching, routing, congestion control, and 
quality-of-service, and discuss recent developments in these areas. The 
course will also cover new developments in networking such as network 
measurements, network management, overlay networking and peer-to-peer 
systems, network security, and new network architectures. The course 
will emphasize a system-oriented and empirical view of internet

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course presents methods and techniques for 
programming parallel computers, such as multicore and high-end parallel 
architectures. Various parallel algorithms will be presented to 
demonstrate different techniques for identifying parallel tasks and 
mapping them onto parallel machines. Realistic science/engineering 
applications and their characteristics will be discussed. Parallel 
architectures to be considered are shared-memory and distributed-memory 
multiprocessor systems. Programming paradigms for these machines will be
 compared, including directive-based (OpenMP), message passing (MPI) and
 thread-based (Posix threads) methods. Methodologies for analyzing and 
improving the performance of parallel programs will be discussed. There 
will be a class project in which each student parallelizes and tunes the
 performance of a large computation application or develops/improves a 
tool that helps this process. Each student will prepare one lecture for a
 selected topic. Offered during odd years.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will focus on the physics of 
reliability of small semiconductor devices. In traditional courses on 
device physics, the students learn how to compute current through a 
device in response to applied voltage. However, as transistors are 
turned on and off trillions of times during the years of operation, 
gradually defects accumulate within the device so that at some point the
 transistor does not work anymore. The course will explore the physics 
and mathematics regarding how and when things break - a topic of great 
interest to semiconductor device engineers. Prerequisites: ECE 60600

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The mathematical background needed for the 
performance and stability analysis of computer communication networks is
 developed. Point processes, Markov processes, and queuing processes are
 used in the modeling and analysis of queues, interconnected queues such
 as ARPANET, and random multiple access networks such as Xerox's 
ETHERNET. Distributed control of random access networks and centralized 
control of queuing networks is considered. The techniques developed are 
useful in the design of computer systems as well as computer networks.
