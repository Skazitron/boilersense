Credit Hours: 2.00.  One of the primary goals of this course is to 
provide you with opportunities to enhance your pedagogical knowledge and
 skills so that you can become a culturally inclusive and effective 
teacher. Hence, learning to teach science in this class will involve 
conceptualizing science as a verb and not as a noun. To make the 
distinction more precise, we prefer to use the term critical 
cross-cultural science education instead of science education when 
referring to the teaching and learning of science in the increasingly 
culturally diverse context of schools in the US. Critical cross-cultural
 science education is defined as the process of actively engaging 
students in collaborative inquiry about what science is; whose interests
 are served by science; who decides what science is and what gets funded
 as science; and what kinds of individual and collective roles 
individuals could play as informed and responsible citizens in 
supporting the advancement of science to benefit society. Admission to 
teacher education required. At least 9 credits of science content 
required. Typically offered Fall Spring.

think about how to provide meaningful opportunities to learn for all the
 students in our mathematics classrooms. The notion of "diverse" here is
 also taken broadly. All students have special needs, but it is 
sometimes helpful to think about the needs of particular groups of 
students while at the same time avoiding reducing differences among 
students to stereotypes. Issues of diversity here include, but are not 
limited to race, culture, gender, disabilities, language, SES, and

Credit Hours: 3.00.  EPICS is a service-learning design course in which 
teams of students from across campus work together on long-term projects
 that benefit the community. Project work centers around the 
engineering, technology, and computing needs of a community partner, but
 interdisciplinary team interaction is an integral element for project 
success. Students may participate in EPICS multiple semesters and 
participation for multiple consecutive semesters on a project team is 
encouraged. Teams are composed for first-year students through seniors. 
Most EPICS projects last at least one year, though partnership with the 
community organization continues for several years. Projects are 
intended to solve real problems, are defined in partnership with their 
community partners, and span the complete design process cycle [problem 
identification - specific development - conceptual design - detailed 
design - delivery - service/maintenance - retirement]. You receive 
academic credit for participation in EPICS. How academic credits are 
applied to your major depends on your degree program and is determined 
by your department and/or advisor.
