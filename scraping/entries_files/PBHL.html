software. One priority of the course will be to have students perform 
many analyses on real data sets, via SAS take-home labs, to prepare 
students for real life applications in analyzing data and interpreting 
results. Students will gain experience in preparing data for analyses by
 merging data sets and recoding variables. Typically offered Fall 
Summer.
