development, and incident investigation. The health and safety manager 
often forms a bridge between upper management and front line employees. 
As such, the successful health and safety manager needs skill sets which
 transfer across organizational levels.  This course will explore 
strategies managing an effective health and safety program within an 
organization. Management strategies will be viewed from multiple 
perspectives. In relation to the front line employee, topics will be

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Exposure to chemicals happens every day in human 
life through the living environment and diet; yet the health impact and 
toxicological consequences of these exposures are often unknown to 
general populations. This 300-level course examines basic concepts of 
toxicology in human health as they apply to the exposure of 
environmental agents, e.g., chemicals, metals, and poisons in daily life
 and attempted poisoning in criminal cases and political assassins. With
 an emphasis on historical accounts of poisonings and case analyses, the
 course describes commonly encountered chemicals and poisons, their 
symptoms, clinical diagnosis, basic toxicological mechanisms, and 
medical interventions. Students will also learn some of the large scale 
environmental and occupational incidents that have led to legal actions,
 and the role of toxicology in forensic investigation of purposed 
poisoning. The course is ideal to students who are inspired to become a 
future healthcare professional in any of the health-oriented

 of nuclear and radiological installations, and examines nuclear cyber 
and information security measures.  Issues and approaches for nuclear 
security concerns, both state-level (e.g., nonproliferation and 
deterrence) and asymmetric concerns (e.g., nuclear smuggling and nuclear
 terrorism) will be addressed.  The integration of safety and security 
and the use of alternative technologies will also be covered. Group 
exercises and simulations in applied nuclear security scenarios will 
complement lectures given by a number of national and international 
experts. This course is designed for both "technical" (engineering and

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Historically, toxicology has been defined as the 
study of the adverse effects of xenobiotics. Today, toxicology 
encompasses much broader areas, including the study of endogenous 
compounds, physical agents, and even using toxicants as research tools. 
Basic and introductory toxicology courses cover the principles of 
toxicant metabolism and target organ toxicity. This course, Analytical 
Toxicology and Toxicologic Pathology is focused on the research and 
clinical applications of these principles. Two major areas will be 
covered: (1) principles of toxicant detection in biological matrices and
 (2) the assessment of pathological effects caused by toxicant exposure 
in biological systems. Laboratory sessions associated with each major 
topic allow students to have hands-on experience in these advanced 
analytical and pathological technologies. This course provides a unique 
opportunity for students to learn techniques that research and clinical 
toxicologists use daily in scientific or clinical laboratories. The 
course is suitable to both graduate and upper-class undergraduate 
students who are interested in toxicology, forensic science, veterinary 
medicine, environmental and occupational health, food toxicity, 
pharmaceutical drug testing, medical laboratory science, and general 
human and children's health.  Typically offered Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This internship course provides didactic training 
and practical experience in clinical diagnostic medical physics. 
Students will spend 3-4 hours per week learning the responsibilities of a
 medical physicist in MRI quality assurance (QA) such as MRI system 
performance testing, setting up weekly MRI QA procedures, analysis of 
MRI QA data, and annual clinical system evaluations. In Part I students 
will observe and review the weekly MRI QA tests performed by the MR 
Technologists  on clinical MRI scanners and be involved with data 
analysis of these tests (image quality assessment, reporting). Annual 
MRI system performance evaluations of different clinical scanners will 
be observed and discussed. This includes assessing magnetic field 
homogeneity, slice position accuracy and slice thickness accuracy, and 
performance of radio frequency coil tests on the various coils available
 at different clinical MRI sites in the Indianapolis area. Students will
 also work as a team with the instructors on a course project to develop
 and evaluate advanced MR QA methods and procedures. Prerequisites: HSCI
