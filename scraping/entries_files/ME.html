<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Orthopaedic tissues, such as bone, cartilage, 
tendon and ligament, serve functions that are largely mechanical in 
nature and that are critical for our health. This course is structure 
around classical topics in mechanics of materials and their applications
 in biomechanics and musculoskeletal tissues. Primary emphasis will be 
on the mechanical behavior of tissues, including elastic and failure 
properties as well as more advanced topics such as anisotropy, 
nonlinearity, viscoelasticity, poroelasticity, damage and fatigue. 
Importantly, the theories used to describe these mechanical properties 
were originally developed for advanced engineering materials such as 
fiber composites, polymers, elastomers, hydrogels, etc. Thus, while the 
theories will be presented in the context of biological materials, 
potential applications are much broader. Tissue microstructure and its 
importance to the material properties will be covered. Mechanics of 
whole bones and implants (composite and asymmetric beam theories) and 
the mechanical function of native and artificial joints (contact 
mechanics, lubrication and wear) may also be discussed, time permitting.
 Some homework assignments will emphasize the use of experimental data 
to develop and test theoretical models via nonlinear curve fitting and 
optimization using Matlab. Students will receive an introduction to 
tissue mechanics literature to better understand how the concepts 
presented in class are used in the research setting.

1.  Define the specialty engineering disciplines, and how they apply to 
systems engineering, the system life cycle phases, and the product 
development life cycle phases.
2.  Describe how the specialties contribute to the general phase gates 
and reviews that comprise a product development life cycle.
3.  Describe how the specialty engineering disciplines apply to writing 
each of the four types of system requirements, how their elicitation is 
enhanced by integration of the specialties with the systems engineering 
discipline.
4.  Write 'good' requirements from the perspective of the specialties; 
explain the characteristics of 'good' specialties requirement, and their
 verification.
5.  Define how the specialties are applied in systems engineering 
activities, beginning with concept exploration through the later phases 
of the product development life cycle to system acceptance and 
validation: functional analysis, decomposition, interface analysis, 
performance directly related to the specialties, requirements allocation
 and traceability, and verification planning.
6.  Explain the key principles of each "-ilitie" and essential 
computations or decision-making methods applicable to each discipline.
7.  Describe the application of the specialties to the general 
methodology for trade-offs and analysis of alternatives, economic 
analysis, and life cycle costs.
8.  Demonstrate an understanding of how each "-ilitie" contributes to 
successful design reviews and program phase gate reviews, to effective 
technical project management, and to effective application of systems 
engineering principles.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses MBSE or Model-Based Systems 
Engineering (i.e. the model-based version of Systems Engineering) with 
an emphasis on its intelligent implementation using SysML graphical 
language for systems representation. The other two pillars for 
implementing MBSE are also covered: a methodology (OOSEM) and a tool 
(Cameo Systems Modeler). The coursework incorporates theoretical 
concepts learned in earlier systems engineering classes and is 
structured around the Object Modeling Group's SysML which is used in 
modeling systems. SysML's application to real-life projects and 
businesses to define, track and visualize various aspects of a system is
 investigated. Case studies from a variety of disciplines - including 
engineering and healthcare - are used as teaching tools.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Integrated Model-Based Systems Driven Product (and 
Process) Development, or SDPD (Systems Driven Product Development) is a 
methodology and framework for integrating system behavioral modeling 
with downstream design and manufacturing practices to plan multi-domain,
 complex, systems. SDPD is an implementation of MBE (Model-based 
Engineering) which integrates MBSE (Model-based Systems Engineering) and
 PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) to create the "Digital Twin" of a 
product/process and support the digital transformation resulting in the 
digital enterprise of Industry 4.0 (4th Industrial Revolution). The 
course covers key concepts and definitions pertaining to SDPD including 
MBSE, PLM, Digital Manufacturing, Digital Twin, Digital Thread, Industry
 4.0, Interoperability, Traceability, Validation/Verification, 
Optimization, and Predictive Analytics. State-of-the-art engineering 
software tools are taught and used by students to design, optimize and 
verify multi-domain complex products (or systems) following the SDPD 
methodology. The graduate level project consists of a comprehensive 
implementation of SDPD methodology in real-life/industry relevant design
 and optimization of complex (multi-domain) systems.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  During this course, students evaluate the 
engineering aspects and physical principles of available AM technologies
 (binder and material jetting, sheet lamination, vat 
photopolymerization, directed energy deposition, powder bed fusion, and 
material extrusion technologies) as well as these technologies' most 
relevant applications and criteria in order to successfully select the 
AM technology that is best suited for the embodiment of a particular 
design (material compatibility, interface issues, strength 
requirements). The topics of this course are grouped into three modules:
 (1) AM Technologies (2) Design for AM (3) AM Process Planning. During 
the first module (50% of the course), the historical development of AM 
is examined and then the underlying physical principles of current AM 
technologies are evaluated. The second module (25% of the course) 
focuses on investigating the mathematical principles and technical 
aspects of design optimization methods for AM (including topology 
optimization). The third module (25% of the course) incorporates product
 evaluation (mechanical properties and dimensional accuracy), process 
optimization, and applications. Students taking this course will create 
original products using CAD/CAE systems and topology optimization tools.
 Students will hone skills on image post-processing, segmentation, 
vectorization, and generation of STL files. Students also will execute 
tasks using several 3D printers and manipulate different AM technologies
 including material extrusion, vat photopolymerization, and powder-bed 
fusion. They will also have the opportunity to visit local industries in
 the areas of manufacturing, design, and materials.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The objective of this research course is to prepare
 students to address mechanical systems design and innovation challenges
 through appropriate advanced optimal design methodologies. This course 
will focus on current design approaches, which are rapidly expanding in 
research and industrial applications, but are not commonly included in 
engineering curricula. The course also focuses on the theoretical 
aspects of multi-objective optimization, global approximation methods 
(metamodel-based optimization), and applications in mechanical 
engineering systems. Students of this research course will acquire an 
understanding of state-of-the-art analysis and optimization tools 
through hands-on experience and the involvement in research projects. 
The research experiential learning will prepare students to design 
innovative mechanical systems and to increase their problem solving 
capabilities through the use of effective design methodologies.
