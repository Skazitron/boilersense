Credit Hours: 3.00.  (HIST 43000) African women's history is rich and 
deeply layered.  In this course, we will examine the social, political, 
economic, religious, and cultural experiences of women living in Africa.
  Although we look at women in the pre-colonial and slave trade eras, 
the focus will be on women during the nineteenth and twentieth 
centuries.  Much of our reading and discussion will consider not only 
women, but also gender as we think about women's interactions with men 
and children.  This course is concerned with the historical forces 
shaping African women's lives, as well as with ways in which women have 
been active agents in the making of their own histories.  Students can 
expect to engage with a number of different types of texts (e.g. firms, 
novels, scholarly analyses, and primary sources.)  Typically offered

Credit Hours: 1.00.  The capstone project for the minor is an 
independent, directed study that serves as a culmination for the 
student's research interests in WGSS. The purpose of the capstone is to 
provide an enriching experience for the student, which will help to 
focus and crystallize thinking and research in the minor. Typically, at 
least one semester in advance of graduating, the student confers with 
faculty in the WGSS program to determine a course of action. Most 
students will request to work with an instructor from a prior course to 
develop a research paper or creative project that extends on research 
conducted previously in that instructor's course. If students are unable
 to find suitable arrangements with previous instructors, they should 
consult with the Program Director who will assist them. The capstone 
will ordinarily be directed by a full-time faculty member.
