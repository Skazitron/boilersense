Credit Hours: 2.00.  This elective will emphasize the major disease 
states, rational drug selection, especially with a limited medication 
formulary, desired therapeutic outcomes, and the provision of complete 
pharmaceutical care to patients in developing countries. The impact of 
drug therapy on health care, economics, and quality of life for diverse 
populations will be emphasized. Students will prepare to provide care in
 a cross-cultural environment in which resources are limited. 
Instruction is provided through a combination of lectures, discussions, 
and presentations. Enrollment is limited to Doctor of Pharmacy students 
(068) DP-C status or by consent of course coordinator.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Picking up where Biotherapeutics Part 1 left off, 
the first part of this course will provide a detailed overview of the 
preclinical optimization process and studies that are the foundation for
 translational experiments in humans. The interplay of drug 
pharmacology, disposition and safety in various disease contexts will be
 a major emphasis. Current approaches to improving human prediction of 
efficacious dose, pharmacokinetics and safety through computational 
modelling and numerous experimental technologies will be examined. 
Innovative solutions to managing risk will also be covered. The second 
part of the course will cover the process and stages for clinical 
development of a new therapeutic for the purpose of registration and 
marketing. A description of studies and regulatory interactions for 
completing an Investigative New Drug (IND) filing and preparation of a 
drug substance for human dosing will be followed by diverse clinical 
study design frameworks. The use of diagnostics and patient tailoring 
will be emphasized along with emerging trends in biostatistics, health 
outcomes analysis and the growing influence of digital technologies in 
the clinical trial process. An examination of each formal stage of drug 
development and associated data analysis, decision making endpoints and 
regulatory interactions will be a core emphasis. Case studies 
highlighting the complexity of the process will support learning 
throughout the semester. Integral to the course will be an emphasis on 
ethics guidelines, clinical trial costs, and the co-dependence of all 
roles involved. The course will conclude with and overview of a New Drug
 Application (NDA) submission and FDA decision process for drug 
approvals.
