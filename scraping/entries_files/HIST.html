<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  In early modern Europe, roughly 100,000 people 
(predominantly women) were put on trial for witchcraft. About half this 
number were executed. This course seeks to understand how and why these 
horrific events occurred at this particular time and why more trials 
occurred in particular areas of Europe. Using thematic and geographical 
approaches, we will investigate the ancient and medieval roots of these 
witch hunts, and look in detail at the trials and executions of the 
accused, using trial records, anti-witch tracts from Church officials 
and other primary sources, as well as secondary sources from a wide 
range of modern authors. We will also pay special attention to the role 
that gender played in the witch hunts, looking at the various ways in 
which women were targeted during this period, and the roles gender may 
have played in witchcraft accusations. In addition to examining 
canonical works on witchcraft and witch trials, we will read some 
feminist interpretations of the witch hunts by historians and scholars 
from other disciplines. The course will also look into how ideas about 
witches crossed the Atlantic, using Salem as way to examine similarities
 and differences with the European "witch craze". Students will also 
have an opportunity to examine how witches and witch hunts have been 
portrayed in popular culture, from 17th century English plays to modern 
films and television. Overall, students in this course will seek to 
understand why the "witch craze" occurred, and what short- and long-term
 impact this phenomenon had on European and early American culture and 
society. Typically offered Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The Cold War is an upper division course that will 
examine one of the most critical eras in modern history. A time period 
that spanned roughly from 1945 to 1989, the Cold War was hailed as an 
epic battle between communism and capitalism. In reality, the Cold War 
was a more complex struggle over a broad range of issues-ideological, 
cultural, economic, and strategic. As each side tried to protect its own
 national interests and way of life, a cycle of distrust and animosity 
quickly formed that would shape U.S-Soviet relations for the next four 
decades. Some of the questions we will be examining: Why was there a 
Cold War? To what extent was it inevitable? How did the Cold War become 
hot (Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, for example)? Who won the Cold War? 
What were the consequences of the Cold War? Typically offered Fall

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an overview of European 
history from approximately 1600 through 1820, a time of considerable 
economic, social, and intellectual change. During this period, Europe 
moved from what historians now consider the "early modern era," or the 
"Old Regime," to the modern era. This process came about thanks to the 
economic boon Europe gained from its colonies in the New World, paired 
with the emergence of new theories of science and politics. The course 
looks at the period through the various lenses of society, economics, 
and culture, moving through the colonization of new lands, the 
intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment, the French Revolution 
and Napoleon, and the "Restoration" of Europe in the decade following.

destroyed this liberal agenda: civil rights and black power, the New 
Left, the counterculture, second-wave feminism, the sexual revolution, 
the Vietnam War, and the globalization of the economy, and finishing 
with the more conservative order that emerged in the early 1970s to deal

integrate the insights of multiple disciplines when analyzing and 
drawing conclusions about historical information, including social, 
physical, and natural sciences.
4.  Develop an awareness of the focus of a variety of scholarly 
disciplines and understand the types of questions they ask, the types of
 conclusions that they draw, and the types of evidence they use to 
support their findings.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Public history can be defined as the practice of 
interpreting the past for and with the public outside the classroom. 
Public historians often say that they put history to work in the world 
helping different audiences sort through the meanings of the past and 
understand how the past continues to effect our lives today. The class 
will consider key moments, people, and themes in American History from a
 public history perspective, considering how the past is interpreted at 
museums and historic sites, through film, and online. No previous 
knowledge of American history is expected. This class will be taught 
entirely online. We will utilize our online environment to reproduce 
some of the best elements of a traditional face-to-face class, but we 
will also be able to explore digital projects, exhibits, and films.
