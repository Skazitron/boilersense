synthesize physical processes in the atmosphere and their coupling to 
the ocean, ice, and land. We quantitatively explore climatology with an 
equal balance of physical principles and scrutiny of available modern 
data. Topics include: visualization of atmospheric/land 
surface/oceanographic climatological data sets; theories of climate 
dynamics; and climate change. Beginning with radiative balance and 
simple energy balance models, the course progresses toward understanding
 the effects of radiative-convective forcing and rotation on the fluid 
envelopes. Analysis of data in an interactive computer-enabled 
environment is an important part of the course. By the end of this 
course, the student should know how the Earth System behaves at large

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course develops basic skills and knowledge 
critical to analyze issues of energy use, climate change, and 
sustainability that incorporate both societal and scientific 
perspectives. The goal of this course is not to arrive at particular 
consensus solutions to the problems associated with these issues but 
instead to foster an informed (through information literacy) debate that
 will ultimately be waged as solutions are sought. Working in teams the 
students work throughout the semester to complete a capstone teamwork 
project and a group presentation. Counts for Great Issues course in

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course is designed to teach graduate students 
the skills necessary to successfully garner extramural graduate, 
postdoctoral, and project funding. Topics will include identification of
 funding sources and development of research objectives and strategies. 
Emphasis will be on writing concise fellowships and full NSF-type 
research proposals. Class meetings will be interactive with an emphasis 
on peer review. Each student will complete a quality research proposal 
based upon their own research. Any graduate student with a nascent idea 
for a science or engineering project is encouraged to enroll. We have 
found that this course works especially well to help newer MS or PhD 
graduate students develop a research project, improve communication with
 their advisor, and organize their research priorities regardless of 
whether they use this course to submit a proposal.
