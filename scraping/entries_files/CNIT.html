Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines both the traditional and 
contemporary forms of cybercrime, including hacking, insider threat, 
Internet child pornography, cyberbullying, hacktivism, and 
cyberterrorism. Students will learn how computers can be either the 
target (e.g., hacking) or the tool (e.g., child pornography) for 
committing cybercrimes. In addition, this course will apply a variety of
 sociological, psychological, and criminological theories to help 
explain, "Why do some people engage in cybercrimes when others do not?" 
Theories discussed include: social learning theory, space transition 
theory, routine activity theory, social cognitive theory, techniques of 
neutralization, and personality characteristics.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This design-based research course explores and 
applies methodological and theoretical perspectives to the research, 
design, and evaluation of learning experiences and environments that 
integrate computational thinking or cyberlearning within a certain STEM 
discipline. Design-based research seeks to shape and even engineer 
learning environments and experiences "in the wild." Is a series of 
approaches with the intent of producing new theories, artifacts, and 
practices that account for and potentially impact learning and teaching 
in naturalistic settings.

study and apply design-based research to evaluate and improve learning 
environments. Specifically, the course focuses on using design-based 
research as a methodological approach to combine instructional design 
and research in a cyclical and interdependent manner. Students are 
expected to apply this approach with the goal of simultaneously solving 
practical problems and developing a sharable theory by connecting design
 features to valued outcomes. Students should have prior knowledge of 
educational research methods, have an educational project to work on or a
 dataset ready to be analyzed.

data systems, and workflow systems. 
4.  Demonstrate understanding and knowledge of the core concepts of high
 performance computing, which include: The continuum of high performance
 computing architectures, and the appropriateness of each architecture 
type to problem solving for a wide variety of applications; The effects 
of communications architecture and performance characteristics on 
application performance; The effects of component reliability and 
operating systems on Petascale computing; The use of commodity 
components in high performance computing, and the trends and forces that
 motivate their use; The design of high performance computing systems to
 meet specific application needs and resource constraints; tools and 
techniques of cluster and high performance computing, such as scheduler

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Information Security Management explores the issues
 surrounding the alignment of business and information security. More 
precisely, once the context of information security is understood in 
terms of the business and the problems with the current state of 
Information Security Management are identified, the course pursues 
solutions to those problems in terms of people, policy, process, 
procedures, and technology. The product produced as a result of this 
pursuit is an Enterprise Security Architecture, mapping business needs 
to technology implementation. The enterprise security architecture 
produced is dynamic and maintainable, thereby assuring traceability and 
accountability. Permission of instructor required.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course meets the requirements of a research 
seminar for the CIT graduate program. Students focusing on homeland 
security and related research areas are encouraged to take this course 
to expand their knowledge of the field in general and in their specific 
research areas. The students will present their research to one another 
to gain knowledge of topics in the subject area. The student numbers 
will include PHSI student research assistants, interns, and students 
focused on homeland security research topics. The creation of this 
course will provide these students more structure for engagement, 
learning and research. Students taking the course will construct a 
research paper formatted for publication in a homeland security research
 journal. This course will also promote the interdisciplinary nature of 
homeland security from information technology to public policy 
generation and agent-based computer modeling. Permission of instructor 
required.
