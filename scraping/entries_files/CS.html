 you can tell whether it is safe to click the link or not.
12.  Understand where, when you upload a video to a cloud service (e.g.,
 YouTube), the video is stored
13.  Understand whether if a new virus appears, the virus protection 
software on your computer will prevent the virus from infecting your

The course emphasizes the duality between formulating questions that can
 be answered by statistical data analysis tools (the statistical 
perspective) and the algorithmic challenge of actually extracting such 
answers using available parallel and distributed computational resources
 from massive datasets. The topics cover three areas: (1) algorithmic 
concepts necessary for big data analytics, (2) bid data systems, 
including data management and programming, and (3) advanced analytic 
methods to address characteristics of real-world big data problems.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (BIOL 47800) Bioinformatics is broadly defined as 
the study of molecular biological information, targeting particularly 
the enormous volume of DNA sequence and functional complexity embedded 
in entire genomes. Topics will include understanding the evolutionary 
organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene 
products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological
 processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is 
interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science
 with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods 
from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for 
bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and 
senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is
 to develop the skills of both tool users and tool designers in this 
important new field of research.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Machine Learning is concerned with computer 
programs that "automatically" improve their performance through 
experience (based on data). As an introductory course to machine 
learning, the course introduces the fundamentals of modern machine 
learning. It will give a broad overview of many concepts and algorithms 
in machine learning, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised 
learning. Topics include decision tree learning, instance-based 
learning, perceptron and linear modeling, probabilistic modeling, neural
 networks, support vector machines, ensemble learning, learning theory, 
and unsupervised learning with clustering. This course will provide a 
combination of theoretical knowledge and practical, hands-on experience 
in solving real-world problems through the applications of machine 
learning. Basic computer science concepts, data structure, algorithm, 
programming experiences, knowledge of linear algebra, basic statistics, 
and probability is required.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will cover the key concepts and methods
 used in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). Throughout the course
 several core NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, information 
extraction, syntactic and semantic analysis, will be discussed. The 
course will emphasize machine-learning and data-driven algorithms and 
techniques, and will compare several different approaches to these 
problems in terms of their performance, supervision effort and 
computational complexity. Prerequisites: A background in linear algebra,
 calculus, statistics and probability, and completion of CS 57800 or 
equivalent are highly recommended. Strong programming skills in any

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The area of randomized algorithms has grown from 
being a tool in computational number theory to finding widespread 
application in algorithms in all areas of computer science. Two 
practical benefits of randomization are its simplicity and speed. Deep 
and important computational complexity connections have been developed, 
 from bridging the gap between discrete and continuous optimization, 
bypassing deterministic barriers in online settings, summarizing massive
 data in polylogarithmic space, probabilistically checkable proofs, 
privacy enhancing techniques, modeling the web and other large networks,
 and sparsifying and compressing complicated combinatorial structures 
such as graphs. Randomization is an essential  key ingredient in the 
algorithmic breakthroughs today and in the future. This course presents 
the basic concepts in the design and analysis of randomized algorithms 
and shows how to apply them to algorithms for a wide range of problems. 
The course covers a broad range of problems benefitting from randomized 
computation including data structures, graph algorithms, online

techniques, and tools for probabilistic analysis of algorithms.
