 design implications required to develop and implement intrusion 
detection and prevention systems that address security violations in 
computer systems.  Topics to be covered include: main classes of attacks
 against computer systems, taxonomy and architecture of intrusion 
detection and prevention systems, network traffic analysis and feature 
extraction algorithms, signature and anomaly based techniques, key 
heuristic based and machine learning based techniques and algorithms for
 intrusion detection.  Intrusion detection and prevention systems 
performance evaluation and issues related to security and defense in 
depth will also be addressed.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
