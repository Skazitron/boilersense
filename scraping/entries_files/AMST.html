Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines the evolution of American 
culture as the United States transitioned from a relatively isolated 
country at the end of the 19th century to an active shaper of a global 
community by the 21st century. We will examine ways in which American 
Culture shaped and was shaped by international relationships that 
transcend nation states. We will explore reactions to, and the results 
of, the spread of American culture both inside and outside the United 
States. By studying traditional cultural forms like art, music, design, 
literature, film, and technology the course will build a foundation from
 which to understand the configuration of American culture. Yet the 
course will also emphasize American culture expression, that in the 
forms of television, advertising, sport, cartoons, social media, video 
games, fashion, food, drugs, and automobiles, have transcended the 
geographical boundaries of the United States to engage in global 
interplays of material cultural exchange.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course, we will study the reasons people in
 the United States have historically decided to create social movements,
 tactics and strategies they use to make and sustain those movements, 
obstacles to their success, and ways of judging their victories. The 
course will draw on scholarship on social movements from various fields,
 especially the field of American Studies. Because social movements are 
created by ordinary people, we will use a variety of sources they leave 
behind: speeches, testimonials, pamphlets, historical accounts, 
autobiographies, manifestos. We will also explore scholarship on social 
movements to try to understand how best to record and analyze the work 
social movements do. The course seeks to provide students an 
understanding of the role of protest movements in American history.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines how science, technology, 
engineering, and data analysis reshape sports. Traditionally, sports 
have been understood as competitions between humans. However, recent 
technoscientific developments have altered this arrangement and have 
changed the ways sports are played. We have reached a place where heated
 competitions not only take place on the fields of play, but also within
 scientific and engineering laboratories. The fundamental question this 
project-based course will address is: how will new and emerging 
scientific knowledge and technological innovations transform sports?  We
 will explore topics ranging from football, baseball, basketball, and 
soccer, to e-sports, fantasy sports, and sports analytics.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  What does the term "transnational" mean? How is the

take a transnational perspective, or examine the transnational variable?
 This course will draw from various fields (sociology, history, 
anthropology, ethnic studies, etc) to explore contemporary scholarship 
on transnationalism in theory and in practice. Specifically, we will 
examine scholarship that either, 1) utilizes the transnational 
perspective in understanding history, the globe, and human 
behavior/interactions, or 2) utilizes transnational behaviors/ties as a 
variable to measurement adaptation. Materials in this course will 
examine-through the lens of race, ethnicity, class, gender, and 
sexuality-individual and comparative transnational case studies related 
to the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. This is a graduate seminar, 
and your active participation in discussions is mandatory. You will be 
asked to lead four seminar discussions on selected topics from the 
required readings, write three memos, and submit an extended book 
review.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course we will study the social movements 
of the past and meet the activists who are working for social justice 
today. We will learn about the history of American protest from 
pre-Revolutionary days to the present in order to understand how mass 
organizations are created and how they can be used to realize the 
American ideals of liberty, equality, justice, peace, and opportunity 
for all. Emphasis throughout is on bridging the academic perspective of 
the classroom with the practical concerns of different communities. This
 will be a "traveling seminar," moving between the classroom and the 
world outside. Our class may meet at the site of a labor, senior, or 
other community organization, hosted by a representative of that 
organization. Other weeks, the organizers will come to us. Students have
 the option of participating in a service-learning project and 
reflecting on the connections between assigned readings and the practice
 of organizing. Our central question will be: what can the social-action
 organizations of the past and present teach us about the possibilities 
for progressive social change in our world today?

Credit Hours: 3.00.  What constitutes the literature of rock music? Some
 would say that a three-paragraph review of the latest CD in Rolling 
Stone is the best and perhaps only example. But what about the countless
 books, essays, articles and other extended works that have been written
 about this music? How (and why?) is it possible, for example, to use 
rock music as the framework for a written discourse on American history 
(and in such discourse, suggest a logical, relevant connection between 
Abraham Lincoln and Elvis Presley?) How could an extended review of a 
rock 'n' roll album transform itself (logically and correctly) into 
first-rate political and social commentary? All of these questions - and
 many more - will be addressed in this course, as we explore the 
'written word of rock 'n' roll' in all its wonderfully complex and 
fascinating permutations.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Belief in the supernatural has been an important 
component of American culture since the founding of the country. From 
the Salem Witch Trials to The Amityville Horror and from the stories of 
Edgar Allen Poe to the television series Lost, there seems to be no 
limit to Americans appetite for myths and legends that deal with the 
fantastic, otherworldly or otherwise unbelievable. This course will 
examine several aspects of this cultural fascination with the 
supernatural, from the mystery of "Area 51" to the legends of the delta 
blues singers. Along the way, we'll examine larger questions, such as: 
Why is belief in the supernatural of continuing relevance to American 
culture? How does the popular and new media (especially the Internet) 
perpetuate this belief, and is there a danger in doing so? To what 
extent are the American character and its definition of self-identity 
shaped by the belief in the supernatural?

just the physical and virtual world, but our physical and virtual 
self-identification. It considers challenging questions-and intriguing 
possibilities-about how we define ourselves when the physical, spatial 
and temporal limitations of "the real world" are lifted. It will look at
 the processes or strategies we use to define ourselves as we spend more
 time online by means of increasingly sophisticated technology, what 
level of importance are we giving to our sense of American self-identity
 in the online world (from a historical, social and cultural 
perspective)? Is it possible to interpret the Constitution to help 
adjudicate virtual "property disputes"? Are the rights of avatars 
"self-evident"? And, when we "jack in" (to borrow a term from Gibson's 
Neuromancer) to the Internet, how much of our American history and 
culture do we take with us?
