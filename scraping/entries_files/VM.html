3.  Improve the student's understanding of how the basic science 
material provides the foundation for solving problems, thereby 
increasing the students perception of relevance, motivation and 
retention of basic science information.
4.  Create a continuum from the pre-clinical curriculum into the 
clinical curriculum so that students are exposed to clinical information
 earlier while simultaneously reinforcing basic science concepts later 
in the curriculum.
5.  Help students develop the skills of acquiring and integrating 
information and applying the information to solve a problem early in the
 curriculum, and provide continued opportunities to practice and refine 
that skill.
6.  Practice the problem-solving method of 
hypothesis-formulation/speculation, investigation, refinement, and 
conclusion/diagnosis.
7.  Increase the student's awareness of the ethical and societal issues 
in veterinary medicine through discussion of the ethical, legal, and 
socioeconomic ramifications of the clinical cases presented.
8.  Foster the development of self-assessment skills and appropriate 
habits for expanding both knowledge and skills including utilizing 
appropriate resources to adequately.
9.  Encourage students to develop good teamwork skills, interpersonal
