 is become ever prevalent within commercial production. No longer are 
these elements done solely by the Hollywood elite or used strictly 
within the film industry. Professionals are utilizing all kinds of tools
 in digital video, audio, graphic design and animation to create moving 
elements that tell a story and communicate concepts to solve 
communication problems. Students will learn basics in the production 
process, framing and movement, key framing, and design principles. 
Students will also learn basics in client relationship and business

examination of data visualization through lecture, readings and hands-on
 experience with current visualization tools. Students will obtain an 
overview of the various types of data, the fundamentals of the 
visualization process for information and scientific visualization, and 
examine detail visualizations workflows that aim to answer "when" 
(temporal data), "where" (geospatial data), "what" (topical data), and 
"with whom" (trees and networks) questions when visualizing data. After 
taking the course students will have both the theoretical foundation and
 practical skills needed to create insightful visualizations for a wide

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (CNIT 33100) This course teaches the techniques and
 principles needed to create realistic three-dimensional virtual 
environments in game engines. The course will examine the principles of 
physics that determine how light propagates through the world and is 
eventually perceived by a human eye. Global illumination techniques that
 approximate these principles are described, followed by an in-depth 
examination of how game engines then approximate these solutions in 
order to create virtual environments that can run at real-time frame

and horror genres.  These effects can range from the recreation of 
historical venues, to fictional characters and to worlds not yet seen.  
This course serves not only to address this facet of the history of film
 and cinema, but also the techniques and technology of visual effects

foundation for nearly all graphics-intensive interactive applications. A
 thorough understanding of how game engines work is therefore a 
requisite element of the game development process and lever for research
 in most domains involving interactive simulations and games. As game 
engine development, research, and application is a large and complex 
topic, the course is split into two semesters of study. The two courses 
are structured similarly but cover different aspects of development on 
and within game engines. This course introduces students to the 
fundamental technologies and skills required to develop video games 
using a modern game engine. Students are taught using a student-led, 
active-learning pedagogy in which students co-develop and present 
lectures, demonstrations, and assignments for their peers, with 
facilitation by the course instructor. The focus of this course is 
primarily on the technical, functional, and theoretical dimensions of 
game development, prioritizing technical soundness over design and 
creativity (which are covered more explicitly in a separate course). As 
research in this field continues to rapidly iterate, the latest findings
 are incorporated into each new offering of the course, refreshing its 
content as the technology evolves in its implementation and theoretical 
underpinnings. Production of original research focused upon an aspect of

explore and identify which visualization tools are better suited to 
visualize different types of data, and understand the role visualization
 plays in understanding what the data represent. This course gives 
students an in-depth view of the various branches of visualization and

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Visual Analytics (VA) provides a fast way for 
people to make sense of large number of data, and has applications in 
many sectors. This course will introduce Visual Analytics through 
foundational theories and a broad range of techniques and tools, 
focusing on using visualization methods to reason and solve complex 
problems in a wide variety of applications. Visual analytics is the 
science of analytical reasoning facilitated by interactive visual 
interfaces that synthesize human and computational ability to attack 
large complex problems.  It is concerned with analytical reasoning, 
interaction, data transformations, data visualization, analytic 
reporting, and technology transition. While the different visual 
analytics applications share common theories and strategies, each of 
them has its unique data composition, visual representations, and 
analytical needs and strategies. Through survey and study a broad range 
of visual analytics applications, students will be able to apply visual 
analytics on their own applications, analyze and break down a complex 
analytical problem into proper components and steps, evaluate different 
visual analytic techniques and strategies, and finally design and 
develop an effective visual analytics solution toward the problem.
