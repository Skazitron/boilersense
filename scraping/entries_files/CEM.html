<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course presents traditional project delivery 
methods and contrasts them with design-build project delivery. The 
course focuses on the principles, tools, and procedures used in the 
design-build project delivery method. It provides students with 
sufficient education to become certified (following additional 
examination) by the Design Build Institute of America as an Associate 
Member and dependent on employment experience, a full Member. 
Traditional project delivery methods, Design-Bid-Build, Construction 
Manager as Agent, `Fast Track', and other `rip and read' methods are 
losing popularity to project delivery methods that take a more 
collaborative approach. Collaboration requires a different way of 
thinking about a capital construction project and working with others in
 project delivery. Constructors must move from a transactional, 
arms-length relationship where the project is viewed as a low-price 
commodity to a full-suite delivery of services resulting in a high-value
 product. This requires collaboration with the Owner and other members 
of the project delivery process, something that has been missing from 
traditional project delivery methods. Active student participation is 
required. Student participation will be facilitated through assigned 
presentations, in-class projects, field trips to local projects, and 
guest lectures. Students who complete the course and achieve DBIA's 
minimum requirements (Fundamentals of Project Delivery, Principles of 
Design-Building Project Delivery, Post Award, and Contracts &amp; Risk 
Management) will be eligible for recognition by DBIA.

understanding of the issues related to facilities management for owner 
organizations.  The course is oriented toward upper class and graduate 
students familiar with the delivery of capital construction projects and
 provides an owner's perspective of capital construction and ongoing 
operation. The course will focus on the total life-cycle cost of a 
capital construction project beginning with planning, business 
rationale, economic analysis, and programmatic specifications. The 
owner's perspective on annual operating costs will be examined including
 calculation of daily, weekly, monthly, and annual operating costs. The 
implications of stewardship and customer service will be reviewed and 
analyzed including the implications on total life-cycle costs. The human
 resources implications of operating a facility will be reviewed 
including determination of staffing requirements to meet various levels 
of service as well as tools and techniques to determine and manage 
contracted services. Numerous case studies will be described and 
discussed  which will demonstrate the importance of careful planning and
 budgeting of annual and periodic maintenance. Issues of sustainability,
 regulations, and other legal factors will be discussed and examined.

engineering, and economics. The focus will be on the prioritization, 
stewardship, management and decision-making roles within the engineering
 division of a large public works agency. Various infrastructure 
planning concepts will be reviewed and discussed. Numerous case studies 
will be described and discussed, which will demonstrate that in order to
 plan and implement a successful public works project, many 
controversial issues must be faced and difficult problems must be 
solved. Decision-making at agency and other levels of government will be
 discussed with respect to reports prepared by planners covering 
engineering feasibility, environmental and social impact assessments, 
and financial and economic analyses. Evolving modern planning issues 
will be introduced and discussed, including sustainability; 
environmental economics; environmental justice; uncertainty and 
risk-benefit analysis; partnerships with private entities versus total 
privatization; and the optimum staff-mix utilization in-house versus 
outsourcing.
