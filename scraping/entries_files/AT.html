global and national policies that lead to the regulations and practices.
 Aviation sustainability is comprised of multiple areas of impact such 
as economic, environmental, operational, and social. Students develop an
 understanding of existing sustainability assessment frameworks such as 
GRI that have general sustainability assessments along with specialized 
aviation industry frameworks. Using a multiple attribute analysis 
approach, students develop metrics and analyze the potential impact of 
sustainability initiatives in the aviation and aerospace industry. 
Prerequisites: STAT 30100 or STAT 31100 or STAT 50100 or STAT 51100 or
