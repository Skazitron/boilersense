 that students possess when beginning their advanced practice in nursing
 education.  Students explore their assumptions about advanced practice 
in nursing, its historical context and definitions of the various 
advanced practice roles, conceptual underpinnings and role competencies.
  Students develop an appreciation for how evidence based practice 
influences advanced practice in nursing. They develop skills that 
include using information communication technologies, identifying 
problems, posing questions that lead to evidence sources, searching and 
differentiating among various sources and types of evidence.  Typically 
offered Fall Spring Summer.

clinical decision making in advanced practice nursing.  Students use the
 National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate 
Services (CLAS) as the basis for providing culturally competent care.  
As students apply principles of culturally competent communication they 
are encouraged to develop insight and an attitude of resistance to 
stereotyping.  Students gain an understanding of the context of 
vulnerable and marginalized populations through the analysis of social, 
cultural, and economic influences that impact health and illness.

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Historical, ethical, financial, and social 
influences on contemporary innovations in healthcare practices and 
delivery systems are analyzed. The genesis and diffusion of both micro- 
and macro-level innovations are reconstructed with the use of theories, 
organizational and transdisciplinary factors, and effective processes. 
Quality of care issues are synthesized utilizing innovations in care and
 health delivery systems as a framework. With innovative care and 
innovations in healthcare delivery systems as frameworks, quality of 
care issues are appraised. Selected exemplars of successful innovations,
 with an emphasis on strategies to evaluate dissemination and impact, 
are analyzed. Admission to the Nursing PhD program or instructor 
permission. This is one of the first courses taken by PhD students and 
may be open to graduate students outside the School of Nursing with 
permission from the instructor. Typically offered Fall Spring.
