syntax, semantics, and discourse. During the past few decades, there has
 been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large
 part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques
 that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular 
brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have 
been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and 
important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the 
nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have 
significant implications for understanding and treating language 
disorders that result from brain injury. Typically offered Fall.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (HDFS 41800, PSY 41800) This course will explore 
the etiology, neuroscience, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum 
disorder (ASD). Approached from a multi-disciplinary perspective this 
course brings together gene, brain, and behavioral sciences with the aim
 of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin 
with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will 
include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the 
diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will
 be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key
 domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language 
and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also
 consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and 
examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD.
 We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, 
and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate
 back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a
 review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of 
impact of ASD on the family and society. Typically offered Fall.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The clinical practice of audiology encompasses the 
audiological assessment and habilitation/rehabilitation of hearing loss 
arising from a wide variety of medical and environmental etiologies. It 
is essential that audiologists have a firm understanding of the most 
common causes and medical treatments of hearing impairment for all age 
groups. Additionally, the future clinician will be better served by 
recognizing how rapidly information changes in this arena and becoming 
comfortable with reliable educational resources that are available for 
life-long learning in this area. Audiologists also practice in a medical
 setting and thus must be comfortable with the medical approaches and 
terminology used by otolaryngologists, otologists, neuro-otologists, 
pediatricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists and other physicians. 
Additionally, audiologists may be the first contact with a 
hearing-impaired patient and their role in the referral process will be 
emphasized. Typically offered Spring.
