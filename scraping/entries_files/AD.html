<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The expressive power of the human figure, its 
familiarity and its complexity, make it the most challenging of subjects
 and therefore worthy of intense study. In this class students will be 
engaged in the further exploration of both formal and conceptual aspects
 of drawing the human figure. Through drawing the human form, each 
student's sense of perception and ability to visualize will be 
challenged and raised to new levels. The insight gained from figure 
drawing will allow students to find their own approaches to 
self-expression through the human form and art as a whole. Also, 
throughout the semester a wide range of drawing approaches and media 
will be introduced and explored.

negative space for seeing shapes, and value to create the illusion of 
light moving across a volume.
3.  Develop a strong understanding of the skeletal and muscular 
structure of the human body. An emphasis on the overall volume and 
planes of the human figure is also stressed in this course.

1.  Make use of essential tools and techniques for generating, sketching
 and realizing ideas in the field of new media art using DIY strategies,
 commercial as well as open source software and hardware solutions for 
creative production, collaborative and interdisciplinary team work. 	
2.  Use shared knowledge from online communities that is relevant to 
their projects.  
3.  Consider contributing their own findings and knowledge gained in 
this class to relevant online communities (e.g. arduino.cc, 
processing.org, instructables.com, makezine.com, etc). 
4.  Know how to research and find relevant exhibition venues, festivals 
and competitions. 
5.  Find the most effective medium for their ideas and concepts.  
6.  Know how to adjust to a field of artistic expression in which the 
tools (i.e. digital software and hardware technologies) are changing 
rapidly.  
7.  Have developed effective research strategies pertinent to the 
history of Electronic and Time-Based Art.  
8.  Able to analyze key works and artists in the merging field of 
Electronic and Time-Based Art. Be able to place their artistic practice 
in a rich historical context of related earlier art forms such as: 
Kinetic Art, Film, Dada, Fluxus and Performance Art.  
9.  Understand that "A technology is not merely a system of machines 
with certain functions; rather, it is an expression of a social world.  
Electricity, the telephone, radio, television, the computer, and the 
Internet are not implacable forces moving through history, but social 
processes that vary from one time period to another and from one culture
 to another. " (Nye 2006, 47). 
10.  Improve their writing skills toward successful project and 
exhibition proposals, artist statements and research papers according to
 CAA's latest Guidelines for Faculty Teaching in New-Media Arts (2007): 
 "In this emergent field, contributions to theory should be seen as 
having equal significance as aesthetic productions. " (see: 
http://www.collegeart.org/guidelines/newmedia07.html).
