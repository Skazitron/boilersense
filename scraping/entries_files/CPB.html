Credit Hours: 2.00.  Reviews the various types of clinical trials that 
are used in medical research (e.g., therapeutic and preventive). The 
stages and activities in a "typical" trial are defined along with 
factors that influence study design. Key elements of data collection, 
organization, analysis, and interpretation and reporting of results are 
discussed and illustrated using published reports of clinical trials. 
Differences in the design and conduct of trials in human and veterinary 
medicine are considered, including the ethical concerns and costs.

1.  Develop basic knowledge of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal 
agents of disease in animals, including taxonomy, virulence factors, and
 pathogenesis (including transmission), with less emphasis on diagnosis 
and treatment (though these will be discussed). The course includes a 
brief introduction to antimicrobial chemotherapy and judicious use of 
antimicrobial agents.
2.  Learn which agents are considered zoonotic or of other public health
 importance (e.g. foodborne pathogens, bioterrorism potential, etc.).
3.  Practice basic microbiology laboratory techniques.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This advanced clinical pathology rotation is 
designed to take the core skills mastered in CPB 88503 and expand on 
them.  Through daily interaction to the consulting office on clinical 
cases, students will learn to critically evaluate cytologic and 
hematologic specimens as well as laboratory data. Activities that the 
student will engage in include the resident's journal club, weekly 
clinical pathology rounds, large animal clinical pathology rounds and 
other small group sessions with residents and pathologists. The goal for
 the rotation is to begin building a broad base of experience to 
continue building on in the future. Total clinic hours 129.
