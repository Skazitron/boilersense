<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  ENGT 50700 course will provide students with a 
foundation in collaborative leadership and agile strategy. The course 
brings together theories and insights from a variety of disciplines 
including engineering, management, psychology, and social science. 
Increasingly manufacturing management is being called upon to apply 
their technical skills in collaborative environments that cut across 
organizational units and inter-organizational boundaries. Understanding 
how to design and guide collaborations and apply agile approaches for 
meeting strategic objectives is an important skill-set and 
knowledge-base in the 21st Century economy, defined more by open 
networks than the ridged hierarchies of the past. Typically offered Fall
 Spring Summer.
