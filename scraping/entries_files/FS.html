microorganisms in the food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. The 
course will introduce fundamental concepts associated to the 
microbiological transformation of various substrates to produce 
desirable products such as foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals or chemical
 compounds. As an introductory course, the scientific principles of 
fermentation processes will be gradually introduced through the analysis
 of familiar fermented food products, such as bread, cheese, beer, wine,
 cocoa, coffee, etc. Once the fundamental concepts are learned, examples
 of advanced fermentation technology for production of pharmaceutical

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The development of value-added fermentation 
processes requires a complex blend of technoeconomic and market 
awareness, resource gathering, strain selection and engineering, reactor
 optimization and operation, product recovery, and project management 
skills. Keeping these diverse aspects in balance while managing project 
timelines is essential to successful fermentation process - that is, one
 that is both technically and economically successful. This course is 
organized to develop your knowledge of the diverse inputs into design of
 microbial fermentation and your ability to apply concepts learned in 
prior fermentation classes to the design of a fermentation process, 
integrating microbiology, chemistry and processing with basic marketing 
and business concepts. Students will be organized into project teams for
 the semester and challenged to design market, develop, prototype, and 
scale up a new fermentation. Classes will include guest lectures from 
experts in the fermentation industry and academia. Project teams will be
 organized and project leaders selected to manage communication between 
individual groups and the instructors. Final product concepts will be 
presented to faculty and peers for evaluation.
