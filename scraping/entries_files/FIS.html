Credit Hours: 2.00. Forensic science is the application of scientific 
methods to matters involving the public. One if its principle 
applications is the scientific analysis of physical evidence generated 
by criminal activity. During this laboratory course you will learn basic
 techniques used to analysis forensic evidence. This will start with 
concepts in evidence documentation and collection. You will then learn 
concepts used in pattern recognition, forensic chemistry and biology, 
and trace evidence. There will be hands on activities in all these 
disciplines. Topics will include but are not limited to crime scene, 
fibers, hairs, explosives, fire debris, serology, DNA, illicit drugs, 
fingerprints, footwear, questioned documents, inks, glass, paints, blood

in the classroom and translates that to the real world of forensic 
science. This is usually completed at the end of the student's 
undergraduate career in Forensic Science. The experience of an 
internship can aid with the transition to a crime laboratory. However,

principles of population genetics. The course will cover the theroy 
behind population genetics that includes a historical perspective to the
 current accepted models of population theiry; examine the relationships
 between allele and genotype frequencies, and the fundamentals of 
molecular evolutionary genetics. Typically offered Spring.
