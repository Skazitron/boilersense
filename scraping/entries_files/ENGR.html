skills in managing complex problems related to design, systems analysis 
with computational tools, and academic professional development. Through
 multiple experiences, students will learn effective methods to design 
and analyze behaviors of complex engineering systems with an eye for 
innovation. These experiences will develop their skills in teaming, 
project management, logical reasoning, sustainability, coupled with 
oral, written and visual communication for multiple audiences. This

activities, and individual and team assignments are employed across an 
array of contemporary socio-technical challenges to provide students 
with the opportunity to apply conveyed theory and methods to rigorously 
structure problems, understand involved stakeholders, utilize innovation
 motifs and analogical reasoning to develop robust views of potential 
solutions spaces, tailor solution design to stakeholder context, 
consider the full suite of functional, social, and emotional dimensions 
that could influence solution prioritization, and document and 
systematically assess underlying solution assumptions to iterate toward a

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course provides students with opportunities to 
study how engineering is intertwined with larger economic, social, 
cultural, and technological dynamics in an era of intensified 
globalization. Its major goals are to help students understand and 
appreciate what engineering is, how engineers are trained, what 
engineers do, and how engineering and society interact. The course 
approaches these themes through discussion of: the relation and 
interaction of engineering, science, technology, and society; the 
historical origins and development of engineering as a profession; 
diversity issues in engineering and other STEM fields; engineering in 
cross-national/cultural contexts; and contemporary challenges related to
 globalization, ethics, and sustainability. In summary, the course is 
designed to help students understand what it means to identify as, 
and/or work with, engineers. Recitation sections and/or independent 
projects (at the instructor's discretion) provide further opportunities 
for students to expand their knowledge and improve their skills in 
relation to course themes. Typically offered Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course helps students learn and effectively 
employ high-impact design principles and structured problem solving 
methods to address complex multi-stakeholder socio-technical challenges.
 Case discussions of historical and contemporary high impact solutions 
to complex challenges are used to introduce techniques to frame 
problems, structure ambiguity, intentionally design non-incremental 
solutions, and communicate, trial, and iterate solutions to drive 
adoption and multifaceted sustainability. Techniques are drawn from 
multiple schools of thought such as business, design, engineering, and 
the social sciences. Over the course of the term, multi-disciplinary 
student teams directly apply cumulative learning to address selected 
parts of a real-world complex societal challenge in close collaboration 
with a partner organization, in an experiential learning format. This 
course can be counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in 
Innovation and Transformational Change and the Burton D. Morgan Center
