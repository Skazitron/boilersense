discussion of a framework for analyzing consumers' decision making; (ii)
 review of relevant psychological, sociological and economics concepts; 
(iii) discussion of marketing research methods for studying consumer 
behavior. We apply the concepts covered in these topics to measure 
consumers' beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behavior and predict how 
consumers will react to different marketing strategies. Finally, we 
consider the application of behavior theory to the design of marketing 
strategies, including product design, pricing, and advertising.

course of many two-week sprints. Every project team will be provided 
with a project description, data dictionary, and access to the dataset 
(or directions in where to find the necessary data), as well as an NDA 
to read, understand, sign, and return to your professor before you can 
gain access to the data. These are tasks that might be required of you 
to perform when you work on a new project or have a new client. However,
 due to our short module term window, I want you to focus on understand 
the problem and developing the solution following INFORMS Certified 
Analytics Professional (CAP) Framework.

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 2.00.  Intellectual property (IP) has become a strategic 
opportunity for creating value for the firm. Firms are tasked with 
understanding how to utilize intellectual property as a competitive 
advantage in multiple market contexts. In the current economic 
environment, intellectual assets can be the largest portion of a firm's 
total wealth. Strategic management of these assets is very critical. 
Managing intellectual property is about transforming a firms ideas, 
know-how, etc., into learning, products, and ultimately cash flow. In 
Managing Intellectual Property, we examine this topic by viewing 
intellectual property as both a legal asset (property ownership) and 
business asset (value-adding). The focus of Managing Intellectual 
Property is on the integration of IP generation, IP protection, and 
strategizing functions of the firm in creating value with an IP 
portfolio. Concepts and frameworks discussed/developed in lecture are 
exercised in case studies from multiple contexts. Typically offered Fall

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The objective of the IBE Capstone course is to 
provide students with the opportunity to apply and integrate what they 
have learned from prior courses in "Real World" settings. There are no 
traditional classes. Rather, students will work in self-managed teams of
 5-6 on projects that have both business and engineering elements with 
the support of a mentor; in many cases the mentor will be from a 
sponsoring company. The role of the company mentor is to provide advice 
and guidance to the student team as well as to expose the students to 
the approaches and processes used in industrial and commercial 
organizations. The course instructors will also meet with the student 
teams on a weekly basis to assess progress and provide guidance. 
Possible options for the projects include: "Product Design" and 
"Business Solution". The Product Design projects would be focused on the
 marketing, technical, and economic feasibility of a new product 
concept. The Business Solution projects would be focused on technical 
issues in a business context and developing solutions to a "real world" 
problem presented by a sponsoring company. Examples of these projects 
might include use of 3-D printing for spare and replacement parts or 
incorporation of autonomous transportation into a company's operations 
and supply chain. Typically Offered Fall Spring.

However, I will help you gain a working knowledge of employment laws 
including: The Civil Rights Act, ADA, ADEA, FMLA, FLSA, and a host of 
alphabet soup. We will also apply these laws from posting a job 
description to recruiting to hiring to employee reviews to terminating 
an employee. While I can't guarantee you will never be sued by a 
disgruntled current or former employee, I can help you put yourself and 
your company in the best possible position to defend that suit. And

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  People and leaders in organizations are 
constantly working with members of different backgrounds. This course 
focuses on talent management of gender and diversity for inclusion from 
an individual employee, leader and team/organizational perspective. When
 leveraged effectively diversity has the potential to foster learning, 
creativity, and innovation, but when ignored or misunderstood these 
differences in identity and values can lead to increased turnover, 
conflict, stress, talent under-utilization, and harm career experiences 
and productivity. This goal of this class is to take a multi-level 
(individual and organization) to help you learn how to lead the 
management of diversity and inclusion through a) improving your ability 
to work in diverse teams, as well as b) developing your ability to lead,
 develop, and implement strategies to foster cultural and structural 
change to support improved talent management of gender and diversity 
toward enhanced organizational effectiveness. Men, as well as women, and
 majority and minority individuals, will be able to leverage the skills 
taught in this course when making their own career decisions, as well as
 when managing, being managed by, or collaborating with others; or 
leading and changing organizations to support new ways of working. From 
an individual leadership perspective, we begin by tackling the question:
 "Why does diversity matter in employing organizations and business, 
what is the state of the art evidence-based knowledge, and what does it 
mean to me personally in my career and my leadership beliefs." 
Specifically, we focus on the business and social science processes- 
including attitudes toward in- groups and out-groups, stereotyping, 
identity, privilege, and power, discrimination, bias, equity influence 
opportunity, bystander awareness, and perspective taking- that affect 
how members of different social groups perceive and interact with one 
another. Since managing social identity increasingly involves managing 
work-life boundaries and work and non-work public and private selves, we
 will also learn about authenticity choices and social and public/ 
professional identity boundary management.  From an organizational and 
group perspective, we address the questions "What are best practices for
 successful diversity management?" We will discuss strategies for 
creating diversity through HR and management practices; how to create an
 inclusive culture and positive climate for inclusion and talent 
management, and developing and retaining diverse talent across multiple 
levels of intervention (individual, group, intergroup, organizational, 
and societal). We discuss how to conduct an organizational diagnosis of 
the current diversity climate and barriers and facilitators for   
creating a multicultural workplace and a flexible environment supportive
 of many identities, and how assumptions may vary across industry and 
cultural contexts. In addition to readings and learning logs, cases, 
self- reflections and other exercises, students will have a choice of a 
teachathon project, which will allow them to somewhat customize the 
course to their own major interest-managing themselves or managing 
others. Student engagement and a willingness to share diverse 
perspectives are critical to the success of this course. To facilitate 
an active classroom, a range of participative learning methods are used,
 including learning log reflections, case analysis, experiential 
exercises, small group discussions, and self-assessments, and research 
projects. The emphasis is on exploiting diverse ways of learning as well
 as interaction with real-life examples and situations. The role of the 
instructor in this course is not to provide "the" answer, but to create 
an environment where you can collectively explore, examine and 
experiment with your own ideas. Typically offered Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 2.00.  There is an exponential growth in the adoption of 
big data technologies in every walk of life. Organizations are 
collecting, storing, and analyzing massive amounts of data. This data is
 commonly referred to as big data because of its large volume, the 
velocity with which it is collected and transmitted, the variety of 
forms it takes, and veracity of its origin and content. In order to 
capitalize on the opportunities presented by big data, businesses are 
putting in place technologies, people, and processes. Just collecting, 
transmitting and storing big data creates little value for an 
organization. For many organizations, the term big data currently 
represents only a data infrastructure such as the Apache Hadoop family 
of products. The key to delivering real value from big data is the use 
of analytics. Data must be analyzed and the results used by decision 
makers and organizational processes in order to generate value. The main
 objective of this course is to learn how to collect, process, store, 
and analyze big data. Assignments could easily be completed in Python or
 SQL. We assume no familiarity with Linux and will introduce you to all 
essential Linux commands. Students need access to a computer with a 64 
bit operating system and at least 4 GB of RAM. Note: 8 GB or more of RAM
 is strongly recommended. Typically offered Fall.

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Provides a framework for analyzing tax planning. 
The framework offers an approach to tax planning and business strategy 
that remains useful long after the next revision of the tax code. It 
offers an approach that can be readily employed in an international 
setting. After developing the framework, it will be applied to a variety
 of business settings that integrate topics from accounting, finance, 
and economics in order to provide a more complete understanding of the 
role of taxes in business strategy. Two important concepts will be 
applied: the concept of implicit taxes (tax-induced differences in 
before tax rates of return) and the concept of tax clienteles (the 
effect of cross-sectional differences in tax rates).  Typically offered

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  The objective of this course is to provide 
students with the necessary skills to value and hedge a wide variety of 
derivatives contracts used in financial markets. The main tool of 
analysis of the course is stochastic calculus set in continuous-time. 
Some basic knowledge of stochastic processes would be helpful, but not 
essential: we will cover what we need in class. The course covers 
valuation of securities using modern martingale methods as well as the 
necessary parameter estimation and numerical methods such as Monte Carlo
 simulations. Applications will include derivatives such as options on 
stocks, bonds and currencies, as well as valuation of defaultable 
securities, and modeling the term structure of interest rates and risk 
management with Value-at-Risk. Prerequisites: MGMT 61400, or similar 
coursework with instructor permission. Typically offered Fall Spring.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 2.00.  The course in Market Analysis and Planning examines
 the issues associated with the analysis of market opportunities and the
 formulation of strategic marketing plans to take advantage of market 
opportunities.  Specific analysis issues include the identification of 
customer needs, competitive advantages, and company capabilities.  
Results of these analyses lead to choices the firm makes with regard to 
its market segmentation, target market selection, and positioning.  
Topics introduced in conjunction with these analyses include product 
life cycle analysis, product portfolio selection, and strategic resource
 allocation decisions.  Aspects of resource allocation include decisions
 regarding market research and new product development (or product 
repositioning).  Further, the allocation of firm resources directed at 
fostering market demand is examined, including the deployment of 
marketing communications to potential customers and salesforce efforts 
to attain distribution.  A long-term perspective on market analysis and 
planning is emphasized through the utilization of the Markstrat 
Simulation.  For this computer simulation, student teams participate in 
multi-period decision-making for their respective companies.

Credit Hours: 2.00.  The Internet and other emerging technologies have 
enabled new ways for companies to organize their businesses. Companies 
are also increasingly dealing with digital information that is different
 in many ways from other goods and services. The purpose of this course

affect company strategy, market structure, and pricing. We will use 
lectures, cases, class discussions, games, and team projects to examine a
 variety of topics including pricing and competition on the Internet, 
cross-channel competition and marketing, "Long Tail", pricing of digital
 information, bundling, versioning, network effects, platform, and a 
variety of other topics. Fundamental economic principles will be 
illustrated using business case studies. At times, we will also discuss 
emerging digital technologies, business models and industry structures.

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 1.00 to 3.00.  This course will build on design thinking 
and game design techniques to develop process, policies, and/or products
 that appeal to human instincts. We will cover ideas that provide 
insights into, for example, new product development, entrepreneurship or
 designing HR policies. To name a few examples of projects we will 
discuss, SAP's points-based system to encourage carpooling that helps 
the company save on large gas expenses; at challenge.gov, the Whitehouse
 encourages innovative solutions through crowdsourcing; and at companies
 like Google, and Best-Buy, employees participate in information 
assimilation games called prediction markets providing information to 
senior managers about ongoing projects. In this course, you will examine
 the mechanisms behind designing for human instincts and thereby 
developing an understanding of their effective use in the modern firm. 
Gamification is one form of design for human instincts. In order for any
 design to be effective, it should involve clearly defined strategies 
and well managed execution. To identify effective strategies, and 
metrics for the application of techniques to business, this course will 
draw upon interdisciplinary source material as well as real-world case 
studies. It will also identify a number of significant pitfalls to 
techniques, as well as notable legal and ethical issues, and the 
problems with implementing radical change in established firms. As a 
part of this class, you will be designing, playing, and evaluating 
various games. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
