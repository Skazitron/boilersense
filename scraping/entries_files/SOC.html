analysis of the presence and significance of race and ethnicity in our 
society. The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation and 
critical framework for assessing the origins and manifestations of race 
and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity have historically been one basis for 
differentiation and stratification in the United States and other 
societies, and this persists today. In this course, we will examine the 
emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our 
everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we 
study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? 
How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over 
time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media 
representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial 
hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Analysis of the causes and consequences of global 
development. Topics include: globalization; colonialism and

poverty and inequality; migration; debt and trade; women's empowerment; 
global health; rights and social change; and sustainable development. 
This course will introduce you to the study of global development and 
globalization. The primary questions we will address are: What is 
development? What is globalization and what is it's relationship with 
development? How have the processes of global development produced 
inequalities among nations, regions, races, genders, and classes? Is 
there a "developing" world and a "developed" world? If so, what are the 
differences and how do they relate with each other? How have some 
developing countries become more developed than others? What roles do 
corporations, the state, and civil society organizations play in the 
process of global development? How is global development interrelated 
with the physical environment crises? How do people resist the 
inequalities and perceived injustices of global development through 
global social movements? How are we interconnected economically, 
politically, culturally, socially, and ecologically with people all over
 the world. What are the possible futures of development? To address 
these issues, our focus will be on the developing world, our scope will 
be global and long-term, our methodology will be historical-comparative,
 and our perspective will be social-scientific and critical.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Can children ever become "normal" after long 
periods of isolation? When making decisions, are two or more heads 
really better than one?  Would people like you and me electrocute a 
stranger?  Why do men tend to invade women's personal space?  Are some 
people "more equal" than others in the United States?  Is racial 
hostility a thing of the past, or does it continue today? These are some
 of the questions we will attempt to tackle in Sociology 100.  The 
substance of this course is broad and draws insights from other social 
sciences and humanities, most notably psychology, social psychology, 
political science, economics, and history. Typically offered Fall Spring
 Summer.
