started in research and in the fantastic world of scientific discovery. 
Students will learn the importance of Plant Science research in society 
and how to become active participants of Purdue research discoveries. 
Students will learn about the scientific method and how discoveries are 
made to find answers to world problems. The students will explore 
department and campus resources to identify areas of research interest, 
learn how to search and apply for research/internship opportunities and 
find faculty that can serve as professional models and mentors. We will 
provide opportunities for students to interact and network with faculty

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course, intended primarily for non-majors, 
covers the history of agriculture, with focus on the centers of origin 
of our major food, fiber, and medicinal plants, and their historical, 
cultural, and economic relevance. The course also surveys the biology of
 crop plants, with respect to taxonomy, anatomy, cell structure, 
physiology, development, and genetics. Discussions also center on the 
roles plant biotechnology may play in sustainable agriculture and in 
helping to alleviate problems caused by overpopulation and ecological 
stress.

1.  Recognize the signs and symptoms of plant disease so that you can distinguish between diseases caused by
pathogenic entities and those caused by environmental factors. This is important for the formulation of methods
to manage the disease.
2.  Compare and contrast the survival and spread of the major plant pathogen groups: fungal and fungal-like
pathogens, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and parasitic plants so that appropriate control methods can be used
to mitigate diseases caused by these pathogens. Control measures are based on the biology of the pathogen
3.  Explain how pathogens, hosts, and environments interact in plant disease epidemics to predict the severity of a
disease at a given time. Such information is important in deciding whether to use management strategies.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Plant pathology is the science of plant diseases 
and of the microorganisms that cause them and of our attempts to manage 
plant diseases. The ultimate goal of plant pathologists is to reduce the
 losses caused by diseases, thereby, increasing both the quality and 
quantity of the world food supply. Plant diseases are caused by the same
 types of microorganisms that cause disease in animals and humans and, 
as such, many of the principles that apply to human and animal medicine 
apply to plant diseases. It is the objective of this course to introduce
 students to the major types of plant pathogens (plant pathogenic 
bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and fungi), their basic biology and 
examples of the types of diseases they cause. It will be expected that 
students have knowledge in plant pathology.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is intended to help students understand
 why having some kind of model is probably essential to the scientific 
process. The intent is to show students that they probably already have a
 model in their heads, and they just don't know it! Few biologists 
realize that when they can draw a picture of their system, or explain 
important pathways in words, that this is a model. From there, it isn't 
hard to start some basic math. The course will be a broad overview of 
different techniques that can be used to model biological systems. Each 
lecture topic in this course could itself form an entire course, so 
students will not complete the course as experts in mathematical 
modeling. Instead, the objectives are to: 1) expose students to a number
 of tools in mathematical modeling; 2) give students some practical 
experience with these tools; and; 3) develop a component of their thesis
 research into a model. Permission of instructor required.
