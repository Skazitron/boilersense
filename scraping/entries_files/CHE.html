 arise in modern integrated operation of manufacturing facilities in the
 chemical related process industries. The linkage of these decisions 
levels and sharing of associated data and knowledge via effective IT 
methodology is currently termed Smart Manufacturing in the US and 
Industry 4.0 in Europe. The topics covered in the course include the 
structure of the operations decision hierarchy, role of online process 
measurements, elements of sensor network design, information systems to 
support process operations, plant data reconciliation, detection and 
diagnosis of process faults, plant wide control, real time process 
optimization, production planning and scheduling, and supply chain 
management. Each topic will be addressed by first summarizing the basic 
role and scope of that component, then discussing the structure of the 
decision problem, and then will outline some representative tools 
available to address that decision problem. Each major topic will 
include a lecture given by an industrial practitioner who will offer a

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is designed to introduce fundamentals 
of electrochemistry and electrochemical engineering of primary and 
rechargeable lithium ion batteries (LIBs) to undergraduate and graduate 
students. This course will be reviewing working principles of LIBs. 
Strong emphasis will be given on the Li-ion battery technology, primary 
batteries, nanotechnology implementation and the materials design. 
Beyond conventional Li-ion systems and Pb-acid batteries will be 
discussed. Students will be understanding energy density calculations, 
fabrication and testing mechanism of batteries utilizing engineered 
electrodes, electrolytes and separators. Broader perspectives on 
sustainable, cost effective, longer lasting battery manufacturing will 
be provided.

organic and hybrid electronic materials and devices. This course will 
review how the molecular architecture of small molecule and polymer 
semiconductors can be turned to alter the optoelectronic properties of 
the materials in solution and in the solid state. A number of relevant 
materials interactions will be covered, including: photoexcitation and 
recombination, intermolecular charge transport mechanisms, and energy 
transfer processes. Additionally, we will observe how these processes 
are relevant to applications such as organic field-effect transistors 
(OFETs), organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), organic photovoltaic 
(OPV) devices, and organic memory elements. Finally, a new type of
