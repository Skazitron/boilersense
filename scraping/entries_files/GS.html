 on continuing their education in graduate or professional school. 
During this course, students will learn and discuss the various phases 
of identifying, selecting, applying to and funding graduate or 
professional school programs. Students will also gain a deeper 
comprehension of the qualities and skills that make research mentors 
effective while developing skills they will need to be successful 
mentees and peer mentors. Students will conduct research to identify 
potential programs of interest and develop a statement of purpose.
