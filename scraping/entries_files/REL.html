1.  Introduce students with little or no prior knowledge of the 
religious life of the ancient world to its main contours, especially in 
terms of the range of interactions and borrowings which obtained between
 different peoples cross the oikoumene stretching from the Mediterranean
 heartlands to the eastern reaches of Southwest Asia. 
2.  Introduce students to the study of religion as a modern academic 
discipline, primarily by guiding them in thinking, speaking, and writing
 analytically about religion not as some abstract essence or thing "out 
there", but rather as a force which is shaped by human experience in 
time and space.
3.  Encourage students to think seriously about the meaning of polyphony
 and heterogeneity in historical human experience generally, and in 
religion in particular, by calling upon them to "account for diversity" 
through critically reflecting upon its role in the religious lives of 
ancient peoples.

1.  Learn the main historical, thematic, and literary features of the 
Qur'an as both a sacred book considered sacrosanct and infallible by 
Muslims, and as a literary text whose language, imagery, and forms have 
exerted a wide-ranging influence on the development of art, culture, and
 society from Morocco to Indonesia.
2.  Think, speak, and write analytically about the idea of scripture as a
 force which shapes, and is shaped by, human experience in time and 
space through examining the manifold ways in which the Qur'an has been 
received, preserved, understood, interpreted, and contested by Muslims 
throughout history.
3.  Foster an informed understanding of the role of the Qur'an in 
contemporary Muslim life and thought through examining the ways in which
 classical forms of encounter and interpretation have been projected 
into the present to confront the vagaries of modernity.

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The purpose of the course is for students to 
develop ways of understanding the religions of the West (Christianity, 
Judaism, and Islam) in the context of Western (American) society and 
culture. To do this, the course will focus on three aspects of Western 
religion: notions of God, scripture, and ritual. We will approach these 
phenomena from a comparative perspective, meaning that we will be 
interested in looking at both the similarities between the religions of 
the West as well as those differences that mark each as distinctive. A 
major component of our approach to religion will be examining how each 
tradition is treated in popular American culture, media, and literature.
 We will use various animated series, such as The Simpsons, Futurama, 
and King of the Hill as our guide to each of the topics covered in the 
course. We will also read three novels that will exemplify the aspects 
of Western religion discussed in class. Fiction is particularly 
important in helping us gain appreciations for religious meaning since 
it allows us to "walk in the shoes" of other people-to see the world 
through eyes different than our own. Typically offered Fall Summer 
Spring.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will trace the history of encounters 
and dialogues between Asian religious figures and products and American 
culture beginning with the eighteenth and nineteenth century missionary 
ventures to Asia by Americans and ending with present-day emergent 
religious movements. The course material is weighted toward the late 
twentieth century to the present. We will explore the moments of 
discovery and renewal as well as those of domination and exclusion in 
the encounters between American culture and Asian religious figures and 
products. A central concern throughout the course will be identifying 
how encounters and dialogues permanently affected and continue to affect
 the religious landscape in the United States. The course will focus on 
Hindu, Buddhist, and Sikh traditions in their encounters and dialogues 
with American culture. Both missionaries to Asia and missionary gurus 
from Asia will be subjects of analysis along with Asian immigrant 
communities and new religious movements. In addition to looking at 
important figures such as Emerson, Vivekananda, The Beatles, and Bikram 
Choudhury, we will also evaluate certain religious institutions and 
movements, such as ISKCON and postural yoga. We will ask: how have Asian
 religious gurus and products, such as yoga, transformed American 
religious consciousness and practice? To what extent are Asian religious
 products constructed anew in the context of globalization? How have 
religious products been re-defined and re-interpreted as a consequence 
of global encounters? When have there been moments of violence, 
intolerance, and discrimination against practitioners of Asian religions
 in the United States? Typically offered Fall.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  It is often said that we live in a secular age.  
Among those who believe this, some say that secularism began with the 
Protestant Reformation while others point to the influence of the 
Enlightenment.  In this course we will use these debates about the 
causes of secularization as a framework for analyzing our assumptions 
about religion in the modern western world. The course will focus 
primarily on Christianity as we look at modern trends from both 
"insider" and "outsider" perspectives--i.e., trends of religious thought
 within Christian communities as they adjust to change, and critical 
perspectives on religion that were taking shape between the 16th and the
 18th centuries.  Thus, in the course of surveying Christian history 
from the 16th century to the 20th century, we shall try to understand 
what phenomena lead people to describe our age as "secular" and what 
that description assumes about being "religious." Readings will include 
such primary sources as Luther, Calvin,  Galileo, Spinoza, Voltaire, 
Marx, Dostoevsky, and M.L. King, Jr. Typically offered Fall Spring 
Summer.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines some of the issues raised by 
modern literature that challenge and critique religious conventions. The
 focus is on the modern era, since the last two centuries saw the 
emergence of the literary imagination as a major cultural force while 
traditional religious systems came under greater and greater scrutiny. 
We will consider a handful of prominent works of fiction by some 
familiar and perhaps not so familiar literary masters. All of the 
assigned texts raise questions of religious and personal identity over 
and against other persons and/or groups. Almost all of the assigned 
texts emerge out of, and challenge, the European Christian milieu. As 
you read them, therefore, you are to consider how each text may force 
the reader to raise basic but large religious questions, such as: 
Who/what am I? Who/what am I not? What must I do? What must I know? How 
ought I live to live well? To whom do I have obligations?

apotheosis of the horror of human existence. Our emphasis will be upon 
Western religious traditions (Judaism and Christianity), but the course 
will cover a very diverse range of imaginative expressions, including 
ancient myths of chaos gods, Greek myth and Latin tragedy, Jewish 
legends, medieval Christian epic poetry, 19th C. Gothic novels, as well 
as paintings, sculpture, architecture, music, and modern film. Through 
our examination of fantastic imaginative expressions in their historical
 contexts, we will explore religious attempts to try to come to terms 
with, or even tame,  the monstrous side of the sacred. Typically offered

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Illness is a universal human experience as is the 
desire to make illness meaningful. Despite this universality, cultural 
and religious differences can produce very different interpretations of 
the meaning and larger significance of illness both for the individual 
and those around her or him. This course examines several religiously 
informed understandings of illness (of body, mind, spirit, and 
community) as well as the interpretative and healing strategies that 
different cultures have developed to explain, address, and alleviate 
illness. The root of the English term "heal” means “to make whole,” 
suggesting that healing is ultimately about restoring wholeness. The 
study of various approaches to illness and healing highlights 
cross-cultural specificities not only in conceptions of the self, but 
how healing is related to understanding of community, cosmology and 
sacred narratives. It also raises questions about the differences 
between disease and illness, curing and healing, religion and folk 
tradition. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Do we owe anything to anyone? Is life worth living 
without love or justice, or both? Are they not fundamental virtues of 
human relations, unconditionally necessary for us to live well? If 
justice must be blind, is there room for compassion or desire - is 
justice truly "love gone public"? What happens when there is one without
 the other, or when they appear to be in conflict? What are their 
limits? This course seeks to address these questions by examining some 
of the foremost contributors to how we have come to think about love, 
sex, and justice in American culture in light of certain contemporary 
public disputes. Typically offered Spring.
