momentum, work, energy, power, and intensity to achieve a final goal of 
understanding collisions.  The course will also examine leverage, 
rotational dynamics, and center of mass (throwing, grappling, and joint

 was expanded to finer-grained target ideas creating more steps to make 
concepts more understandable and explicit.  Activities were designed to 
enable students to develop deep conceptual understanding of each target 
area and the structure and sequence were guided by research on student 
learning.  In this class social interactions are used to clarify ideas

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course is aimed at facilitating future 
elementary teachers to learn physical science that will prepare them to 
teach these concepts to future elementary students grades K-6. The 
course will be focused on learning physical science by doing science 
i.e. developing understanding by collaborative activities and discussion
 in the laboratory and lecture and communicating your ideas to others. 
The course will have one 50-minute lecture and two 110-minute laboratory
 meetings each week. The course content is consistent with the CAEP 
(Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation) K-6 Elementary 
Teacher Preparation Standards (Standard 2: Understanding and Applying 
Content and Curricular  Knowledge for Teaching in Physical Science and 
Engineering Design) and the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards) 
Disciplinary Core Ideas (DCIs) for the Physical Sciences (Physical 
Sciences PS1, PS2, PS3, and PS4) as well as many of the Science and 
Engineering Practices (SEPs). The course will be divided into four 
units. 1) Matter and Interactions 2) Motion and Stability 3) Energy and 
4) Waves and their applications. All of these units will be delivered 
through the paradigm of solving engineering design problems. Engineering
 design involves many different practices: problem definition, model 
development and use, investigation, analysis and interpretation of data,
 application of mathematics and computational thinking, and 
determination of solutions.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This is a course in reasoning and meta-cognition 
(thinking about one's own thinking). Students will learn and practice 
important reasoning and problem solving skills by exploring tasks 
requiring analytical thinking and problem solving in three domains - 
solving puzzles, playing abstract games and investigating the natural 
world. These explorations will enable the students to compare and 
contrast how the same reasoning skills are used in different domains and
 how the characteristics of a domain affect those reasoning processes. 
Open to all students. Typically offered Spring.

solving a smaller group of problems that are representable by quantum 
mechanical systems. These problems cannot be solved by traditional 
computers, at least in reasonable amounts of time. This course will 
introduce you to the concepts in quantum mechanics necessary to 
understand these devices and examine in detail the many types of 
problems these computers will tackle. Typically offered Fall Spring 
Summer.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will consider basic concepts relating 
to nuclear reactor theory. A familiarity with basic quantum mechanics, 
mechanics, electromagnetics, and modern physics is assumed. The course 
will introduce the physical principles behind the modeling of nuclear 
reactor cores. Aspects of both diffusion and transport theory will be 
considered in modeling nuclear reactor core neutron distributions,

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Provides modern laboratory experience for graduate 
students in physics. Emphasis is on student initiative in accomplishing 
difficult but meaningful results. The course is intended to fill the gap
 between undergraduate-level laboratory, with detailed description of 
each experiment, and real-life experimental work. Students will share in
 the responsibility of determining how to conduct many of these 
experiments, learn how to use original equipment manuals, redesign 
experiments, and redefine goals depending on the progress.  
Prerequisite:  graduate level E &amp; M and QM courses, undergraduate 
level laboratory course.  Permission of instructor required.  Typically
