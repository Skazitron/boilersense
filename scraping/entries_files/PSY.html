Credit Hours: 3.00.  (SLHS 40100) This course is an overview of the 
neutral systems that underlie the core components of language, including
 speech perception and production, reading and writing, morphology, 
syntax, semantics, and discourse. During the past few decades, there has
 been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large
 part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques
 that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular 
brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have 
been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and 
important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the 
nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have 
significant implications for understanding and treating language 
disorders that result from brain injury. Typically offered Fall.

 of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin 
with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will 
include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the 
diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will
 be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key
 domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language 
and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also
 consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and 
examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD.
 We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, 
and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate
 back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a
 review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of 
impact of ASD on the family and society. Typically offered Fall.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  How does your brain generate your uniquely 
subjective experience of the world? Is it possible to identify distinct 
neurophysiological markers of your awareness of a particular sight, 
sound, taste, or touch? What is the cortical basis of your sense of 
being a self with a first-person point of view that is spatiotemporally 
grounded in a body? How does consciousness relate to attention and 
working memory? Does consciousness have an adaptive function? Might a 
person in a coma or a vegetative state still have some form of 
awareness? Could a computer or a robot ever have what we would consider 
to be genuine experiences? During the past few decades, these and other 
questions about the nature of consciousness have been the focus of 
increasing empirical and theoretical research in neuroscience and other 
disciplines. The main purpose of the course is to introduce students to 
this exciting field of inquiry by exposing them to a variety of 
representative books and articles in the literature. The "backbone" of 
the course will be Stanisla's Dehaenes Consciousness and the brain: 
Deciphering how the brain codes our thoughts (2014). As we go through 
the course, we will use each successive chapter in this book as the 
starting point for a deeper and wider exploration of the given topic(s),
 bringing into our discussion relevant experimental findings and 
philosophical perspectives from other investigators. Requirements: 
Students will take turns guiding discussions and will also write 1-2 
page "response papers" to the weekly readings. Permission of department 
required. Typically offered Fall Spring.

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines how genes regulate development
 and function of the brain to ultimately influence behavior. Genetics 
has come to be an important aspect of research in almost every field of 
Neuroscience and Psychology ranging from neural development to cognitive
 function and dysfunction. However, many students have not had the 
opportunity to explore this in their studies to date. Therefore, the 
goal of this course is to provide students with the background needed to
 understand and think critically about the genetic components of 
Neuroscience and behavioral research. Numerous questions will be 
explored mainly through discussion of research papers. Lectures by the 
professor will fill in background knowledge needed to understand the 
readings. The questions explored will include: What are chromosomes and 
genes? What do they do? How do they do it? How do genes control 
development of the brain? How are single genes manipulated in animals to
 study their effects on behavior? How can genes associated with normal 
or abnormal behavior be identified? What has been learned from 
gene-behavior studies in animals? in humans? What do these studies tell 
us about the nature-nurture controversy? In addition to exploring these 
more traditional aspects of behavioral genetics we will address the 3 
most exciting recent developments. These include the use of transgenic 
primate models, selective remote control of specific neural circuits 
using optogenetics and chemogenetics, and epigenetics, which helps 
explain how environmental factors and behavior itself can change gene 
activity and how these changes may be transmitted from one generation to
 the next. Many behaviors could be used to explore the principles these 
questions address. The readings will be selected from papers that focus 
on learning &amp; memory and mental illness. However, if students are 
interested in other behaviors, papers that involve those behaviors and 
serve our purposes can be substituted. Grading will be based mainly on 
informal presentations of papers and participation in discussions of 
these papers. Permission of department required.
