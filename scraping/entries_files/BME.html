allow students to quantify the loads in the skeleton as well as design 
surgical tools and total joint replacements. In addition to the topics 
on vectors, particle equilibrium, and rigid body mechanics one would 
expect in a classical mechanics course, biomedical engineers must also 
have a working knowledge of skeletal anatomy. Consequently, anatomical 
descriptions and anthropometric data will be incorporated throughout the
 course. As part of the implant design, students will also be introduced
 to more advanced topics in mechanics such as Hertz contact theory, 
shear-lag theory, and composite beam theory.

 flow. The first half of this course focuses on modeling based on 
ordinary differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equation 
(PDE) as well as on how we integrate these equations analytically or 
numerically using software packages such as MATLAB. The other half 
focuses on fundamentals of fluid/solid mechanics and also on the

Drawing inspiration from neuroscience and statistics, Deep Learning 
introduces the basic background on neural networks, presents computable 
neuron models and extends to large networks of neurons. Students study 
deep learning with both real and artificial neural networks, along with 
methods of deep learning about the environment by applying back 
propagation, Boltzmann machines, auto-encoders, convolutional neural 
networks and recurrent neural networks. Students will explore how Deep 
Learning is impacting our understanding of intelligence and contributing

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course material and lectures will focus upon 
how the anatomy and physiology of the target organ system impacts the 
design specifications for biomedical and implants and the biosensors 
that can be part of the command and control strategy for the implant. 
The course material is roughly organized according to motor (skeletal, 
cardiac) and sensory (vision, audition, olfaction, touch) and visceral 
(lungs) organ systems. For each topic area there will be a brief 
introduction to the physiology and neuroanatomy of the target organ 
system or biological environment (e.g. subcutaneous implants). Each 
topic area will have companion lectures demonstrating the extent to 
which biomedical engineers have been able to fabricate functional 
replacement (prosthetic) or assistive (orthotic) devices and tissue 
interfaces (electrodes). For example, issues related to performance, 
powering, communications, command control and user interfaces for 
auditory and visual neuroprosthesis are presented immediately following 
lecture materials describing these organ systems. Although not central 
to the course content, tissue and cellular responses to materials will 
be stressed throughout the semester. Topics will include normal wound 
healing processes, host response to implants and general 
biocompatibility. Lectures will emphasize fundamental principles of 
bioengineering as related to the design of implantable systems and will 
require student participation in classroom discussions. Permission of

Credit Hours: 3.00.&nbsp; Orthopaedic&nbsp;tissues, such as bone, 
cartilage, tendon and ligament, serve functions that are largely 
mechanical in nature and that are critical for our health. This course 
is structured around classical topics in mechanics of materials and 
their applications in biomechanics and musculoskeletal tissues. Primary 
emphasis will be on the mechanical behavior of tissues, including 
elastic and failure properties as well as more advanced topics such as 
anisotropy, nonlinearity, viscoelasticity,&nbsp;poroelasticity, 
damage,&nbsp;and fatigue. Importantly, the theories used to describe 
these mechanical properties were originally developed for advanced 
engineering materials such as fiber composites, polymers, elastomers, 
hydrogels, etc. Thus, while the theories will be presented in the 
context of biological materials, potential applications are much 
broader. Tissue microstructure and its importance to the material 
properties will be covered. Mechanics of whole bones and implants 
(composite and asymmetric beam theories) and the mechanical function of 
native and artificial joints (contact mechanics, lubrication and wear) 
may also be discussed, time permitting. Some homework assignments will 
emphasize the use of experimental data to develop and test theoretical 
models via nonlinear curve fitting and optimization using Matlab. 
Students will receive an introduction to tissue mechanics literature to 
better understand how the concepts presented in class are used in the 
research setting.&nbsp;Permission of department required.

engineering principles such as diffusion and mass transport, with 
specific emphasis on transport in biological systems and barriers, 
pharmacokinetics, and drug distribution. We will examine the existing 
state of art in drug delivery systems: controlled release, biomaterials,
 and polymer-based delivery systems. Finally, we will also discuss the 
current field of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical: identification of 
novel drug targets, latest development in drug discovery, development, 
clinical trials, and product development, going from research to market 
using the latest examples from the pharmaceutical industry.
