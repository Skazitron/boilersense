differences that exist within all human beings. Because the diversity 
among individuals is endless, we cannot study all differences, but will 
study a sampling such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, social 
class, disability, learning styles, and religion/spiritual orientation. 
Issues of poverty, language, and social justice may also be examined in
