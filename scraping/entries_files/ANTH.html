Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course explores the nature of ritual and the 
role it plays in human culture. By exploring central topics in 
anthropology (religion, worldview, gender, economics, and embodiment), 
the course illustrates how human behavior is understood in cultural 
contexts and reveals humanity's diversity and commonality. Ritual in 
Human Life is designed for the non-anthropology major yet emphasizes the
 development of skills used in the anthropological study of human 
behavior and belief.

today testifies to the tenacity and creativity of human societies who 
have faced severe ecological, political, and social pressures throughout
 their histories. During the semester, we will explore six cultures in 
depth through reading ethnographies that explore a broad spectrum of 
social situations across the continent.  Books, videos, and CD-ROMS will
 guide us from deserts to deep forests, from city neighborhoods to 
remove villages, and into communities on every side of sub-Saharan 
Africa-West, Central, East and South.  The authors present different 
backgrounds and interests in specific topics and theories. Africans also
 wrestle with issues we share, like changing family values, religious 
loyalties, interethnic relations, dirty politics, budget cuts, hunger 
and protecting national prosperity. The course requires consistently 
preparing for class meetings, taking an active part in discussions and 
group activities during class, completing worksheets and other 
assignments outside of class, and three essay exams including the final.

ancient societies adapt in the face of social conflict and environmental
 challenges? What lessons can we learn from resilience or collapse of 
states in the ancient past? This course compares the political, social, 
ecological, contexts of the rise and fall of early complex societies, 
from densely populated hunter-gatherers in North America to the world's 
major ancient civilizations in Mesoamerica, the Andes, Nile Valley, 
Mesopotamia, Indus Valley, and China. We will also explore how societies
 responded to 'grand challenges' in antiquity such as climate 
variability, food insecurity, global-intercultural interaction, and what
 modern lessons we might derive from their successes and failures.

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course we will examine a series of urgent 
issues facing the global community through reading ethnography and 
studying social theory. For each issue, we will read recent ethnographic
 research that illuminates the issue as well as social theories that 
connect the issue to long-standing zones of theorizing among social 
scientists. Through careful reading and discussion, students will learn 
about the urgent issues that will shape their professional and personal 
lives, become familiar with theoretical approaches that illuminate these
 issues, and engage in discussion and debate about these issues in a 
diverse classroom. The following issues is a sample of the types of 
global issues that the course will cover: the environment (i.e., global 
warming, environmental critiques of capitalism, the struggle for 
indigenous rights to land, the energy economy), global struggles for 
rights (for indigenous peoples, women, the LGBTQ community, the global 
underclass, stateless peoples), the state system (to include an 
examination of the nature of the state, authoritarian and leaderless 
states, democracy in crisis, the warlord state), technological change 
(social media, AI, cyberwarfare), and violence (weak states, the global 
arms trade, the nuclear threat). Theoretical perspectives to be covered 
include historical materialism, world systems theory, gender studies, 
subaltern studies, postcolonialism, poststructuralism, and others.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The focus of the course is the biological and 
cultural evolution of the human species. The first half of the course 
will examine a variety of "background" issues such as the history of 
evolutionary thought, modern evolutionary theory, techniques for dating 
the past, the nature of the fossil and archaeological record, the 
biological relationships of humans to our closest relatives, and the 
fossil record of those forms ancestral
or closely related to the earliest humans. The second half of the course
 will begin with the appearance in the fossil record, about 5 million 
years ago in eastern and southern Africa, of the Australopithecines, a 
"proto-human" form that is clearly ancestral to our species, and the 
appearance "shortly" thereafter (about 2.5 million years ago) in this 
area of the first definite evidence of cultural (as opposed to purely 
biological) behavior. With the appearance of purposely made stone tools 
at this time our concern broadens to include both biological and 
cultural evolution (and the interaction of the two), as early humans 
expanded out of their original homeland and adapted to diverse 
environmental situations using an increasingly complex array of cultural
 mechanisms.

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Bioarchaeology introduces students to the 
interdisciplinary field that asks- what can we learn from the analysis 
of human skeletal remains from archaeological sites? As such, 
bioarchaeology is the contextual analysis of human remains. Skeletal and
 dental tissues are often overlooked as being innate and unchanging, 
when in fact they respond to the external environment and stressors like
 soft tissues that exist within and around them. The natural and built 
environments can have a profound impact on human biological variation. 
As a result, bioarchaeological research emphasizes biocultural 
interactions and the impact of culture on the human condition (and vice 
versa). Topics covered in this class include demography, health, growth 
and development, diet, infectious and non-infectious diseases, 
occupational markers of stress, migration, and population affinity. The 
course starts with a historical survey of the field, moves into a 
discussion of  ethics in bioarchaeological research, and introduces 
important theoretical considerations that influence practice in the 
subdiscipline. Two subsequent weeks will be spent reviewing basic human 
osteology, age and sex estimation, and taphonomic factors that can 
influence and, ultimately, bias research findings. Weeks 6 through 16 
will be spent surveying the core areas of investigation in contemporary 
bioarchaeological research. The lectures and discussions will be 
supplemented with time in the laboratory, during which students will 
have the opportunity to examine, describe, score, and analyze human 
remains, as well as interpret bioarchaeological data. In addition, 
students are expected to produce an annotated bibliography on a 
bioarchaeological topic of their choice.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Forensic Anthropology, Archaeology &amp; Taphonomy 
introduces students to the sub-discipline of Biological Anthropology 
that addresses human skeletal remains recovered during medico-legal 
investigations. Forensic Anthropology is an inherently applied field 
within Anthropology and compliments the focus of IUPUI's Department of 
Anthropology. Forensic anthropologists are often consulted in 
investigations when a visual identification of human remains cannot be 
made by a medical examiner or law enforcement. The goals of a forensic 
anthropologist's involvement in medico- investigations often includes 
excavation and recovery (i.e., forensic archaeology), estimation of the 
post-mortem interval, the construction of a biological profile (e.g., 
age-at-death, sex, stature, etc.), positive identification, and 
providing conclusions and an opinion about the cause and manner of 
death. Practitioners routinely find themselves working in a variety of 
contexts from local cases of missing persons to mass disasters and 
international human rights projects involving the exhumation of mass 
graves.

depth through reading ethnographies that explore a broad spectrum of 
social situations across the continent.  Books, videos, and CD-ROMS will
 guide us from deserts to deep forests, from city neighborhoods to 
remove villages, and into communities on every side of sub-Saharan 
Africa-West, Central, East and South.  The authors present different 
backgrounds and interests in specific topics and theories. Africans also
 wrestle with issues we share, like changing family values, religious 
loyalties, interethnic relations, dirty politics, budget cuts, hunger 
and protecting national prosperity. The course requires consistently 
preparing for class meetings, taking an active part in discussions and 
group activities during class, completing worksheets and other
