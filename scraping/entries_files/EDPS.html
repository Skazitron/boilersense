</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course provides a solid foundation and set of 
principles for differentiating curriculum and instruction in any 
classroom at any grade level. Students will explore a variety of 
evidence-based strategies, tools, and curriculum models that effectively
 meet the diverse needs of all learners. Through readings, online 
classroom meetings and discussions, case studies, differentiated 
instruction examples, direct application and reflection, students will 
deepen their understanding and need to differentiate. With an 
overarching goal of increasing achievement and developing student 
talents, this course includes the following major components: creating 
positive learning environments that support a) high-quality curriculum; 
b) diagnostic, formative and summative assessments to inform 
instructional decision-making; and c) flexible grouping addressing 
student differences in readiness, interest, and learning profile 
(including learning preference, intelligence preference, gender, 
culture, language preference, locale, and opportunities to learn) and 
appreciating how these differences influence the ways in which students 
learn understanding that process of differentiation involves modifying 
content, process, product, learning environment, and/or affect 
incorporating higher-order thinking skills, creative problem solving, 
project based learning, authentic/respectful tasks, collaborative 
learning, and other evidence based strategies to promote student 
achievement and talent development understanding how differentiation of 
curriculum and instruction fits within specific educational 
interventions and models, such as scaffolding, flexible grouping, 
Response to Intervention (Rtl), and Multi-Tiered System of 
Support(MTSS). Effective teachers do more than teach content; they teach
 unique individuals who enter classrooms with various levels of 
expertise, skills, abilities, social-emotional needs, and learning 
expectations. Effective teachers differentiate curriculum by 
personalizing content based on the particular needs and interests of 
their students. Effective teachers differentiate instruction by applying
 various grouping strategies, technology applications and thinking 
skills. The goal of every effective teacher is that every child learns 
something new every day. Cannot be taken concurrently with EDPS 24000. 
Typically offered Fall Spring.

inter-relationships between theory, empirical evidence, and 
instructional practice. It takes the perspective that experiences across
 different learning contexts are interrelated and may influence each 
other in reciprocal ways. The course views social-emotional dimensions 
of learning as: embedded in person-environment transactions; tied to 
specific instructional (formal and/or informal) contexts over time; 
co-evolving with cognition and language; critical to psychological, 
behavioral, and learning outcomes. The focus is on intersection of 
social-emotional competence, learning, and instruction. The course is 
intended to provide the foundations (theoretical and empirical) that can
 help those interested in formal and informal instructional environments
 make informed educational decisions by considering the social-emotional
 dimensions of learning. Typically offered Fall Spring.

the ability to gather accurate information about student achievement, 
and use that information to make instructional decisions that will 
improve learning. Course activities will focus on assessment tasks 
relevant to P- 12 classroom settings. Typically offered Fall Spring.

phonemic awareness in learning to read an alphabetic language; the 
distinction between phonological awareness (i.e., the awareness that 
oral language is composed of smaller units, such as spoken words and

behaviors, develop IEPs, integrate technology to support learning 
outcomes, collaborate with families and colleagues, and analyze the 
experience of facilitation a classroom and caseload of students. In 
addition, candidates will analyze relationships across theory and 
practice, multiple perspectives and trends, and the application of these
 relationships within educational settings. Candidates will explore 
major theories and concepts related to online learning, virtual 
instruction, twenty-first-century skills, informative literacy skills,

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an overview of mixed methods 
research designs within social science and educational research. The 
focus of the course will emphasize the philosophical pragmatism embedded
 in enacting mixed methods research. Further, the course will 
demonstrate the utility and plausibility of integrating quantitative and
 qualitative data into a single study. This demonstration will be 
accomplished through reviewing the historical context of qualitative and
 quantitative research in social sciences and students' application of 
mixed methods research within their respective fields of study. 
Prerequisites: EDPS 53300, EDPS 55600, and EDPS 55700 and an
