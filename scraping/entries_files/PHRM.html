<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 2.00.  This is an elective class which gives participants 
more experience working up patient cases with multiple complications and
 an opportunity to make recommendations to a team. The material for each
 case will be derived from actual cases and topics will include 
continuity of care problems, typical problems/diseases seen in 
hospitalized patients, and a host of other chronic illnesses. During the
 3-week class, students will have 1-1.5 hours to work on a patient case 
in class and address challenges faced in the clinical setting. The 
second half of class will be used for students to present their 
recommendations to a "medicine team" (made up of your classmates and 
teachers). Students will be responsible for creating a pharmacist 
problem list and making verbal drug therapy recommendations. The 
majority of the grade will come from in-class participation with other 
points coming from online quizzes, communication exercises, and 
follow-up answers from clinical questions. Typically offered Fall.

molecular basis for aqueous and lipid solubility of drugs, 
pharmacokinetic principles that are related to dosage forms, mechanisms 
by which excipients or manufacturing processes affect bioavailability, 
and chemical kinetics applied to the shelf-life of dosage forms. The 
pharmaceutics principles are then applied to successively more complex 
liquid dosage forms: solution, emulsion, and suspension. The excipients 
that are required to prepare the dosage forms: buffers, preservatives, 
emulsifiers, suspending agents, wetting agents, etc. and the method of 
preparing each dosage form in both a compounding and manufacturing

Credit Hours: 1.00. This course will serve as an introduction to the 
role of diagnostics in the clinical continuum of patient care. Since 
most therapeutic decisions are based in part on information obtained 
through utilization of diagnostic testing, it is important for 
pharmacists to have an understanding of these  tests as the pertain to 
diagnosis. As they progress in their training, students will be required
 to evaluate and interpret diagnostic tests to help monitor and fine 
tune drug therapy. This course will provide an introduction to 
diagnostic testing as a whole, with an introduction to differential 
diagnosis and the selection of diagnostic tests. The students will also 
have the opportunity to learn about different types of testing (lab, 
imaging, etc.) and how to critically judge information provided by 
various tests. Finally, the students will be introduced to several 
common laboratory tests that have wide application in the diagnosis and 
treatment of many different disease states. This course will provide a 
background introduction to these tests, allowing the students to gain
