<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course offers students the opportunity to 
learn and apply the core skills required to build and grow engineering- 
and technology-based businesses through lecture, case discussions, and 
weekly activities tied to a semester-long team project. Course content 
includes market analysis techniques to link technology attributes to 
opportunity and vice versa, combinatorial business design and planning 
methods, strategic innovation theories, competitive analysis, methods of
 emergent strategy and risk mitigation, as well as examination of team 
building, firm influence and navigation, and organizational design 
principles. Emphasis throughout is placed on the implications of 
research and development uncertainty, long-lifecycle economics, and the 
management of subcontracts and multi-disciplinary teams often 
encountered when developing and delivering complex engineering outputs. 
Case studies are used to contrast the challenges faced when creating new
 businesses (entrepreneurial) with those encountered in attempts to grow
 an existing enterprise (intrapreneurial). Coursework and project 
activities also facilitate development of business acumen, and skill 
building in conceptual thinking, synthesis, and persuasive 
communication. This course is particularly relevant for engineering 
students intending to progress into managerial roles in technology or 
R&amp;D driven organizations. This course can be counted toward the 
College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and Transformational Change 
and the Burton D. Morgan Center for Entrepreneurship (BDMCE) Certificate
 in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course helps students learn and effectively 
employ high-impact design principles and structured problem solving 
methods to address complex multi-stakeholder socio-technical challenges.
 Case discussions of historical and contemporary high impact solutions 
to complex challenges are used to introduce techniques to frame 
problems, structure ambiguity, intentionally design non-incremental 
solutions, and communicate, trial, and iterate solutions to drive 
adoption and multifaceted sustainability. Techniques are drawn from 
multiple schools of thought such as business, design, engineering, and 
the social sciences. Over the course of the term, multidisciplinary 
student teams directly apply cumulative learning to address a real-world
 complex societal challenge in close collaboration with a partner 
organization in an experiential learning format. The course can be 
counted toward the College of Engineering Minor in Innovation and 
Transformational Change and the Burton D. Morgan Center for 
Entrepreneurship (BDMCE) Certificate in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course covers stress analysis, strains 
analysis, elastic and inelastic constitutive relations, with emphasis on
 plasticity, and the solution of plastic boundary-value problems for a 
wide range of materials, including metals, soils and alloys of various 
types. Specific topics covered by the course include: tensors, stress 
analysis, strain analysis, laws of thermodynamics, basic concepts from 
elasticity, viscoplasticity as an extension of viscoelastic concepts, 
classical plasticity, principle of maximum plastic dissipation, 
Drucker's inequality, yield function and yield surface, flow rule, 
hardening rule, classical models (Tresca, Von Mises, Mohr-Coulomb, 
Drucker-Prager), bounding-surface plasticity, thermodynamics and 
constitutive models, causes of plasticity at the microstructural level, 
noncoaxial plasticity, limit analysis, method of characteristics 
(slipline method) and cavity expansion analysis. Prerequisite:  AAE
