Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course surveys stories of elves, fairies, 
wizards, witches, etc., and explores the allure of all things marvelous,
 strange, and magical. It considers how language itself constitutes a 
kind of magic; examines magic as technology and vice versa, since, as 
Arthur C. Clarke famously declared: "Any sufficiently advanced 
technology is indistinguishable from magic"; and seeks to understand how
 people across history have used stories of magic to reinforce (mystify)
 or upend (defamiliarize) the status quo. Typically offered Fall Spring.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course introduces the concept of pidgin and 
creole languages across the world, with a focus on English-based pidgins
 and creoles. It addresses their geographical distribution and some of 
their cultural manifestations such as music, food and literature on both
 sides of the Atlantic. The course presents a general view of the 
historical events that led to the formation of creole languages and to 
the development of the African diaspora. We will consider different 
varieties of creole languages and (their) cultures including 
English-based creoles in West Africa such as Kru (Liberia and Sierra 
Leone), Nigerian Pidgin and Cameroonian Pidgin; in the Caribbean such as
 Jamaican, San Andreas, Nicaraguan and Limonense, contrasting them with 
the Spanish-based creole Palenquero; and the three most predominant 
creoles in the U.S. - Louisiana Creole, Gullah and Hawaii Creole, to 
understand their characteristics and their history. We will explore the 
ways in which the languages manifest in the music and literature of the 
contexts where they are spoken. Finally, we will consider the African 
diaspora as a fundamental thread that ties (English-based) creole 
languages and peoples together. In exploring these issues, the course 
will draw on a variety of theoretical concepts and traditions from 
sociolinguistics, creole studies and African American studies. Typically

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Environmental Ethics, Policy and Sustainability is 
an interdisciplinary course designed to open new pathways into ethical 
and eco-critical inquiry in the Anthropocene age. The course analyzes 
disciplinary differences in approaching the ethical, the human, and 
environmental problems such as sustainability, development, 
biodiversity, global security, and climate change. Students will explore
 what it means to be ethical in and through an interrogation of our 
contemporary conceptions of what it means to be human. These 
interrogations in turn will prompt us to reconsider human creations such
 as knowledge, culture, and technology, which will push us to genuinely 
think how humans as a species situate their creations within the realm 
of what they call Nature. Students will be introduced to the history of 
environmental studies in the discipline, to the rise of what is now 
known as "postcolonial ecocriticism" to theoretical inquiry into modern 
technology, and to other recent developments in the fields of 
environmental studies. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Project management education smartly focuses a

communication strategies and abilities is often overlooked and 
incorrectly thought of as a soft skill. In this class, we are going to 
specifically address the intricacies of communicating effectively in the
 workplace as an essential skill of project managers. In addition, we 
will also discuss planning and organizing strategies and models, process
 documentation, and management implementation strategies and 
philosophies. We'll learn about these concepts through hands-on project 
work that emphasizes individual and collective approaches to project 
management and gives us a basis for thinking through issues that 
influence the workplace- from emerging workspace design to the effects 
of globalization on distributed teams and organizations. Students should
 leave class with skills and knowledge that they can refer to when asked
 to lead and participate in a variety of projects in different 
organizational contexts.

3.  Revise one's own, peers, and published works - "re-visioning" other 
possible meanings and acting upon those in subsequent draft and class 
discussions. Revision is more than cleaning up a first draft - it's 
about rethinking your initial ideas in light of other possibilities.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will provide an exploration and 
examination into poetics and its relationship with performance. It's 
said that public speaking is the number one fear, even before death. 
With that in mind, students will learn to use their voice and represent 
their voice through performance/oral renditions of their individual 
work, and work that they choose to use that speaks to them. Students 
will view, read, analyze, and discuss, as well as explore the 
structural, figurative, and literary devices of poetic language, while 
at the same time redefining the common rules of verse as a foundation 
for performance. We will investigate and reinforce the "everyday" poetry
 happening around us, which goes unnoticed. We will study some 
traditional poetic forms and contemporary works, which will often be 
performed, produce pieces which integrate more than one artistic 
discipline, and develop a critical vocabulary.  Typically offered Fall 
Spring Summer.
