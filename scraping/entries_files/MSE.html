 mechanics to understand the response of bulk polymers (solid and 
liquid, above and below Tg). The impact of deformation rate and 
temperature on the mechanical response of polymers will be covered in 
detail. The course will start with an overview of linear elastic 
mechanics, move to rubber elasticity, and then viscoelasticity 
(concentrating on time-temperature superposition). We will also cover 
fluid dynamics and the rheology of non-Newtonian fluids. We will 
conclude with a section on deformation, yield, and fracture mechanisms 
(focusing on those phenomena that are unique to polymers such as rubber 
cavitation, drawing, and crazing).

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The characterization of advanced composite 
materials is a combined lecture/laboratory course in which polymeric 
composite laminates will be fabricated of carbon fiber epoxy and 
subjected to classical test methods appropriate to the determination of 
the anisotropic, thermoelastic properties. Properties measured will 
include thermal expansion coefficients, anisotropic elastic constants, 
biaxial strength properties and interlaminar fracture strengths. The 
autoclave processing of composite laminates will be discussed and the 
consolidation, degree of cure and glass transition temperature of the 
polymeric matrix will be modeled. Microscopic analysis of the composite 
will be carried out to observe microstructure and measure composition 
fractions. Lectures will precede each experiment. Typically offered
