Credit Hours: 1.00.  The purpose of this course is to acquaint students 
with the culture of scientific research and the processes of scientific 
discovery and review.  This course will: (1) acquaint students with 
techniques used in presenting short scientific talks, as e.g., at 
national meetings, (2) expose students to procedures used in preparing 
scientific papers, proposals, etc., (3) introduce students to the 
outcomes expected to be achieved by graduate education and the processes
 by which students are mentored and evaluated, (4) help students begin 
formulating their research project proposal, (5) acquaint students with 
guidelines for biosafety and responsible conduct of research and provide
 a forum for discussion of ethical issues confronting researchers, 
particularly those inherent in participating in extramurally-funded 
research, (6) acquaint students with intellectual property issues 
involved in scientific research, (7) acquaint students with core 
research facilities across campus, and (8) expose students to 
discussions regarding the importance of diversity and an atmosphere of 
mutual respect to research excellence.  This course is taken for a 
letter grade and carries on hour of credit.  Typically offered Fall
