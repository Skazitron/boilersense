concepts taught in the general physiology course (BMS 23200, Physiology 
for Veterinary Technicians); 2. Emphasize how understanding basic 
physiological concepts can help in solving clinical cases; 3. Promote 
critical thinking, team work, communication skills and problem solving.

Credit Hours: 4.00.  This is the first of two pharmacology courses in 
the DVM curriculum. The first part of this course encompasses an 
introduction to basic concepts necessary to understand and optimally 
administer and deliver therapeutic drugs, such as pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, dose forms, dosing regimen and prescriptions. In the 
second part of the course, drugs are studied not only based on their 
pharmacological class, but also based on the organs and systems on which
 they act (e.g., heart and vascular system, lungs, autonomous neuronal 
pathways, respiratory system, endocrine system, etc.). This course also 
covers the pharmacology of cancer therapy and drugs used to fight 
pathogens (antifungals, antibiotics, antivirals, antiparasitics). 
Journal club sessions are included to directly relate pharmacology 
instruction to topics currently debated in the field.
