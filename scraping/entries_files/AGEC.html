Credit Hours: 3.00.  Agricultural markets are multi-faceted, having been
 studied using a wide range of analytical tools. This graduate-level 
course emphasizes charactering demand and supply of agricultural markets
 and understanding forces that determine commodity and food prices. It 
also aims to cover a set of economic studies of prices and assist 
students in applying theoretical frameworks and time-series econometrics
 to empirical analysis of agricultural prices. In addition to studying 
prices in perfectly competitive markets, the first half of the course 
highlights several classic models of consumer demand and agricultural 
supply, prices under imperfect competition, price spreads (marketing 
margins), and the economics of information. The second half of the 
course focuses on empirical price analysis. Popular time-series 
econometric tools are introduced to study price relationships over space
 and time, price discovery mechanisms, and functions of futures markets.

 estimate macroeconomic linkages and build them into commodity models, 
and considering consequences of implicit and explicit macroeconomic 
assumptions in much of our work. The changing role of agriculture in an 
economy under structural transformation will be key to understanding 
these linkages and how they evolve, as shown in several new developments
