Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines theories of human development,
 learning and epistemology in the context of Engineering Education. A 
broad survey of readings guides an in-depth study of fundamental 
theories of development and knowledge generation as it relates to 
pedagogy and research. A rich body of theoretical literature will be 
studied in order to explore its relation to engineering education. Work 
in the course aims to construct answers to the following three 
questions: (1) How do theories of human learning, development, and 
epistemology help us think about engineering? (2) How do they relate to 
engineering education? (3) How do they inform research method and 
practice in engineering education? No restrictions. It is helpful, 
however, for students to have engaged in prior reading-and writing- 
intensive courses that required them to synthesize large amounts of 
information. For this reason, it is recommended that students are 
enrolled currently in a graduate program at Purdue University.

course is intended to be taken early in a graduate student's curriculum 
and therefore is designed to be a bridge between the student's previous 
experience with engineering (education, work, and teaching) and new 
engineering education research-based approaches.  It is intended as an 
entryway to help students apply an engineering design approach to the

globalization from the perspectives of the emerging Asian economies and 
Europe, as well as the United States. This course is designed for 
practicing engineers and engineering educators.  It is taught within a 
learner-centric, highly interactive, collaborative learning environment 
in which students are expected to learn from the experiences and 
thinking of each other, as well as from the instructor, and other course
 resources. The course places emphasis on reading, writing, web-based

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00. Design is central to engineering: it is an integral 
part of the engineering profession and how we educate future 
professionals. Design cognition and learning is an area of engineering 
education research that seeks to understand what designers know and how 
they learn, and what tools best support design activity (e.g., 
collaboration, innovation, etc.). This research draws from many 
perspectives including cognitive psychology and the learning sciences, 
organizational learning, engineering and product design, architecture, 
human-centered interaction, and creativity and innovation. Themes in the
 course include (1) design knowledge, (2) what theories help understand 
design knowing and learning, (3) what are ways to study designers and 
design activity, and (4) how may design research inform design education
 and practice? Permission of instructor required. Typically offered
