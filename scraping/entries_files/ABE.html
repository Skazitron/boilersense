Credit Hours: 1.00 to 3.00.  This course provides students that have 
completed the research experience in ABE 22600 and ABE 22700 an 
opportunity to continue their professional development by serving as 
peer leaders in the classroom. ABE 22600 and ABE 22700 are part of the 
Howard Hughes Medical Institute's (HHMI) Science Education Alliance and 
provide an authentic laboratory research experience with the students 
engaged in hands-on discovery as a scientist with the ultimate objective
 of contributing new viral genomes to the scientific literature and 
public databases. As part of the model for implementing the course-based
 undergraduate research experience in ABE 22600 and ABE 22700, senior 
level students that successfully completed those courses serve as peer 
leaders in the classroom. Peer leaders attend the course section along 
with the currently enrolled students and build competencies in 
leadership by guiding their team on their research project throughout 
the semester. Permission of instructor required.
