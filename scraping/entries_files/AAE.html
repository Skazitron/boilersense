solids, which is the foundation to characterization and understanding of
 high-rate response of materials. Then, the theoretical background and

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course serves as an overview for materials 
behavior for students without a materials background, including seniors 
and entry-level graduate students. Materials are at the foundation for 
all of engineering, as evident by the latest products that we design, to
 the airplanes that we fly, to the latest smart phones. In fact, 
breakthroughs with material research are often accompanied by rapid 
advancements in technology. Thus it is paramount for all engineers to 
have an understanding of the structure and behavior of materials. In 
this class, we focus on the structure of materials, the microstructure 
connection to mechanical properties, and ultimately failure mechanisms. 
 Materials play an important role in both design and manufacturing, 
which will be addressed in the context of components and extreme 
environments. Of specific interest will be defects within materials, 
defect formation/evolution, and their role in strengthening mechanisms. 
Material anisotropy, micromechanisms, and elasto-plastic properties at 
the atomic, single-crystal/constituent, and polycrystal-material levels 
and their use in explaining the deformation and failure characteristics 
in metals, polymers, and ceramics; failure mechanisms and toughening in 
composites; structure and behavior of aerospace materials: metal alloys,
 ceramic-matrix composites, and fiber-reinforced polymer composites. 
Particular topics will also include: elastic deformation, dislocation 
mechanics, plastic deformation and strengthening mechanisms, creep, and 
failure mechanisms; design criteria; special topics. We will attempt to 
have minimal overlap with AAE 55400, Fatigue of Structures and 
Materials.  Therefore we will not cover fracture, fatigue, or stress 
concentrators.

2.  Center on students' ability for understanding, modeling, and 
analyzing SoS problems, which consist of multiple, heterogeneous, 
distributed systems embedded in networks at multiple levels that evolve 
over time. These problems are often large-scale and interdisciplinary, 
involving systems and behaviors found in diverse fields such as 
engineering, economics, social science, policy, etc.
3.  Present developments in addressing system-of-systems problems, 
describes criteria, lexicon, and analysis methodology for their study, 
and, through semester-long team projects, allows students to explore the
 many unknowns that persist in this emerging field.
4.  Know the major subjects covered: distinguishing traits of and 
behaviors of SoS problems, complexity and complex adaptive systems, 
agent-based modeling, modern network theory and analysis tools, modeling
 for decision-making, and exploratory modeling.

</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The usage of materials is the backbone of 
engineering practice. Yet, advances in materials have stagnated due to 
overly conservative approaches, trial-and-error testing, and long 
qualification times. Material modeling offers tremendous opportunities 
to address these issues. This class offers advanced modeling strategies 
at the intersection of mechanics and materials science for both 
polycrystalline and composite materials. The course topics are defined 
as follows: First, advanced micromechanics analysis of modern 
engineering materials with emphasis on relating elastic microstructural 
phenomena to the mechanics of material behavior, via the Eshelby 
inclusion problem and its application to fiber reinforced composites. 
Second, classical plasticity is summarized via phenomenological and 
mathematical formulation of the constitutive laws, including yielding, 
yield surface; von Mises, Tresca yield criteria; Drucker's stability 
postulate; strain or work hardening, normality rule, perfect plasticity,
 and stress-strain law. Third, crystal plasticity is discussed, 
specifically physical and mathematical foundation for plasticity in 
crystalline materials, with a detailed description of the Bishop and 
Hill implementation of the Taylor model for deformation of polycrystals.
 Lastly, concepts of dislocations leading to strengthening mechanisms in
 metals are discussed: (i) by studying the anisotropy of material and 
elastoplastic properties at crystal level, microstructural basis for 
deformation in metals, polymers, and ceramics and (ii) failure 
mechanisms and toughening in metals, with primary emphasis on 
work/strain hardening, solid solution hardening, precipitate hardening, 
and grain boundaries. The course will be comprised of three projects, 
where the student chooses the topic of the third and final project.
