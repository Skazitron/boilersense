Credit Hours: 3.00.  (PSY 41800, SLHS 41800) This course will explore

course brings together gene, brain, and behavioral sciences with the aim
 of developing a better understanding of autism. The course will begin 
with an overview of ASD as a complex behavioral phenotype. This will 
include discussion of the history ASD and the expansion of the 
diagnostic criteria associated with the disorder. This introduction will
 be followed by several classes in which we will examine some of the key
 domains of impairment in ASD:  reciprocal social interaction, language 
and communication, and restricted and repetitive behaviors. We will also
 consider the deficits associate with, but not defining of ASD, and 
examine co-morbid conditions frequently present in individuals with ASD.
 We will then address the topics of brain architecture, neurochemistry, 
and genetics and gene expression, all of which we will attempt to relate
 back to the behavioral features of autism. We will end the course with a
 review of treatment practices and their efficacy and an examination of 
impact of ASD on the family and society. Typically offered Fall.

Credit Hours:  3.00.  This course gives students a basic grounding in 
the class of statistical techniques known as multilevel modeling (MLM), 
also known as hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), mixed models, or 
random coefficient models. Primary discussions will be on applications 
of these models to the study of marriages, relationships, families, 
aging, and child and adult development, but also will touch on 
biomedical, educational, and economic examples. The focus is on three 
types of multilevel models: growth-curve models, organizational models, 
and daily experience models. Students will also learn how to use SAS 
Proc Mixed for conducting MLM analyses. Students are assumed to have 
taken at least two graduate statistics courses and have a solid 
understanding of regression analysis.  Prerequisites:  STAT 50100 and
