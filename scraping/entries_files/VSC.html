examinations and infertility work-ups in the male; estrous cycle 
characteristics, diagnostics and control in females; breeding management
 strategies, pregnancy diagnosis, and management of gestation; 
investigation and control strategies for pregnancy loss; management of 
parturition and treatment of dystocia; normal post-partum changes and 
diseases of the peri-partum period and the pathophysiology and treatment
 of uterine infections. Material will be presented in both comparative

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The first week of the 3 week block students will 
spend 100% of the time on the neurology service. Week 2 and 3 of the 
block the students will spend 100% of the time on the physical 
rehabilitation service. The course is a 3.0-credit elective clinical 
rotation. Currently the neurology service receives three days per week 
(M, W, F) and the physical rehabilitation service received new 
appointments one day per week (T) and recheck appointments daily (M-F). A
 PVM clinician will lead this elective rotation. The majority of cases 
will be small animal patients, but some exposure to large animal, equine
 and small ruminant cases may take place. Students are also expected to 
practice clinical and technical skills which are required for each 
service. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.

service.
2.  Integrate knowledge to provide patient care, including medical 
management, preoperative, surgical, and postoperative care of 
client-owned animals.  This includes principles of analgesia, fluids, 
drugs, nutrition, exercise limitations and/or rehabilitation. 
3.  Develop greater knowledge, clinical judgement, surgical/technical 
skills, and diagnostic capabilities that enable management of more 
complex cases.
4.  Increase the student's clinical experience in diagnosis and 
treatment of common ailments for which physical rehabilitation is 
recommended.
5.  Develop exposure to both orthopedic and neurologic conditions in the
 more chronic stage of treatment.  Typically students are exposed to 
such conditions during the peri-diagnosis period.  This rotation would 
give students exposure to disease and post-operative healing 2-8 weeks 
following diagnosis/surgical repair.
6.  Learn how to appropriately select PT modalities for a patient.
7.  Learn how to appropriately use different PT modalities.
8.  Learn how to perform goniometry and limb girth.
9.  Learn how to perform a gait lab analysis and how to interpret the 
findings.

1.  Demonstrate appropriate sanitation for an ICU run.
2.  Demonstrate appropriate sanitation for an ICU cage.
3.  Identify and use all the common equipment in the ICU: doppler blood 
pressure unites, oscillometric blood pressure unites, continuous ECG 
monitoring, syringe pumps, IV fluids pumps (all models), omnicell, 
various warming unites.
4.  Empty and quantify drains and urine collection bags using 
appropriate aseptic technique.
5.  Demonstrate appropriate knowledge and utilization of the Snyder 
oxygen cage.
6.  Set up the oxygen cage door and provide oxygen in the cage.
7.  Set up and provide flow-by oxygen.
8.  Use PPE appropriately for isolation and barrier patients.
9.  Place peripheral IV catheters (3 placements minimum during the 
rotation).
10.  Wrap IV catheters appropriately (including central lines).
11.  Place a urinary catheter (either indwelling or temporary) at least 
once during the rotation.
12. Meet a fellow student or clinician at the door of ICU with a patient
 that they would like to check into ICU. Take the patient from the 
student or clinician and set up the cage, catheter, fluids, medications,
 etc required to allow the student or clinician on the case to focus on 
writing the treatment orders.
13.  Draw up all medications required overnight for all cases in the ICU
 if not already completed by the student on the case after checking with
 the student or clinician to ensure the animal is continuing to receive 
those medications overnight.
14.  Note missing information on ICU treatment sheets. Contact the 
clinician or student on the case to obtain that missing information (ex.
 clinician phone numbers, call parameters, etc.).
15.  Be comfortable and competent contacting a clinician about a 
situation where the call parameters dictate that the clinician be 
called. Document the information discussed on the phone. Communicate the
 information to the technicians. Complete the doctor's directive.
