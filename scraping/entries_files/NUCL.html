reviews and discusses the history of energy use by the world, the 
relation between energy usage and quality of life, the social impact of 
energy use, and the environmental constraints on energy usage. In 
particular, the role that engineering disciplines play in solving energy
 problems will be discussed. The full impact that the various energy 
alternatives have on economic and environmental issues will be reviewed 
in order to provide a rational basis for energy choices for the future.
