Credit Hours: 3.00.  For students who think they hate chemistry! This 
unique course may be used for 3 hours of lab science credit for students
 outside the Schools of Science, Engineering, Health Science, 
Technology, Agriculture and Nursing. The course offers a totally new 
approach to chemistry, using decision-making activities related to 
real-world societal issues that have important chemistry components 
(such as the hole in the ozone layer, nutrition, consumer products, 
energy and pollution). A main goal is the development of critical 
thinking, problem solving and writing skills. The laboratory portion is 
performed in small groups using common household chemicals. This course 
should be of greatest interest to students in the Schools of Education, 
Humanities and Liberal Arts.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This is a comprehensive one-semester biochemistry 
course that emphasizes molecules and molecular reaction mechanisms, 
building upon the principles conveyed in general chemistry and organic 
chemistry. This course is designed to cover the essential elements of 
biochemistry traditionally covered in a two semester series. Topics to 
be covered include: Amino acids, peptides and proteins, molecular models
 and structure-function relationships, enzymes, enzyme kinetics and 
enzyme mechanisms, carbohydrates and carbohydrate metabolism, aerobic 
metabolism, lipids and membranes, lipid metabolism, nitrogen metabolism 
and integration and regulation of metabolism. Special emphasis will be 
placed on connections between biochemical principles and the fields of 
medicine, human health and disease, nutrition and biotechnology. This 
course should serve as excellent preparation for higher-level 
biochemistry courses as well as standardized pre-health professional

Credit Hours: 1.00.  CHM 33901 is a laboratory course based on two 
modules from the Undergraduate Research Inspired Experimental Chemistry 
Alternatives (URIECA) developed at MIT that are designed to introduce 
students to cutting-edge research topics in biochemistry. The course 
provides students with a research-inspired laboratory experience that 
introduces standard biochemical techniques in the context of 
investigating a current research topic, for example, acquired resistance
 to cancer drugs. Techniques include protein expression, purification, 
and gel analysis, PCR, site-directed mutagenesis, kinase activity 
assays, and protein structure viewing. CHM 33901 was designed as the 4th
 semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in 
chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science 
students at Purdue. However, the course is open to other students who 
meet the pre-requisites.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Catalysts are materials which speed up chemical 
reactions without changing or consuming the catalyst itself in the 
process. They also provide selectivity or specificity to particular 
products which are more desirable than others. This course will focus on
 understanding the principles of homogeneous, heterogeneous and 
enzymatic catalysis, will include applications of catalysis in 
environmentally sustainable processes.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to the application of ion and electron
 beams in the chemical analysis of gases and of surfaces. Emphasis is on
 the unity of the phenomena that underlie the preparation, manipulation,
 and analysis of ion and electron beams and on the analogies between 
inelastic reactions of ions and electrons, including those with both 
gaseous and solid targets. Mass spectrometry is covered in some depth, 
and a number of newer aspects of particle spectroscopy are treated, 
including ion scattering spectrometry, Rutherford scattering, energy 
loss spectrometry (ion and electron), ion kinetic energy spectrometry, 
ion cyclotron resonance and Auger spectrometry. Applications of these 
techniques feature structural analysis (compositions of mixtures, 
molecular structure of organics, electronic state assignment in simple 
ions), chemical preparations (ion implantation), and isotopic analysis. 
The underlying chemistry is explored, particularly in considering the 
kinetics and dynamics of unimolecular fragmentation and in terms of the 
factors that affect the cross-sections of inelastic collisions. Offered 
in alternate years. Prerequisite: CHM 42400.
