Credit Hours: 3.00.  Different composite materials have been used for 
many years in the automotive industry to create components that have 
unique characteristics, such as being strong and light. The trend in 
using composite materials is accelerating to meet lightweighting 
requirements to meet the next generation of fuel economy standards. An 
interesting lightweighting application combines the use of continuous 
fiber composite material with resin. The continuous fiber composite 
material forms a lightweight shell, while the necessary support 
structure can be created by supporting it with a fiber-filled plastic. 
This so-called hybrid technique can create extremely lightweight strong 
parts that can be manufactured in large volumes. This course focuses on 
Development of Low-Cost Carbon Fiber for Automotive Applications, 
Mechanical Properties of Advanced Pore Morphology Foam Composites, 
Automotive Composite Structures for Crashworthiness, Crashworthiness

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The materials for the construction of automobiles 
are changing from mostly low carbon steels to a combination of steels, 
light alloys, such as aluminum and magnesium alloys, and polymer matrix 
composites. Many of these materials are already used in today's 
vehicles, albeit in smaller volumes. Future vehicles, which will have to
 be much lighter in weight for improved fuel economy and reduced 
environmental pollution, will contain much larger volumes of these 
materials. The selection of materials will not only be influenced by 
their weight reduction potential, but also by factors such as safety, 
durability, processing, joining, recycling and cost. This course focuses
 on materials, their properties, processing technology and design and 
materials selection issues pertinent to designing lightweight vehicles. 
It will provide first-hand knowledge and experience of working with 
these advanced materials. It starts with a broad review of the materials
 scenario and design considerations for lightweight automotive 
structures. It is then divided into two major parts: materials, and 
design and manufacturing. The materials part contains topics on advanced
 steels, aluminum alloys, magnesium alloys and polymer matrix 
composites. It will provide information on material properties, 
processing characteristics and application examples. The design and 
manufacturing part contains information on manufacturing processes for 
light alloys, joining, crash worthiness considerations, recycling and

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The study and adaptation of fluid flow and 
aerodynamics as applied to motorsports design and performance 
optimization. This course is designed to reinforce student's 
understanding of aerodynamics as it pertains to a race car. This course 
breaks down the differences between actual air flow while driving / 
racing versus air flow within a wind tunnel, and how these flows are 
different. It discusses how to evaluate those flows, and determine if 
they need to be improved. It discusses ways to improve the aero on race 
cars. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall.

secrets of the rapidly developing field of high-speed vehicle design. 
From F1 to Indy Car, Advanced drag simulation and Sedan racing, this 
course provides clear advanced explanations for students and engineers 
who want to improve their design skills and to interpret how their 
favorite race cars aerodynamics is designed. It differentiates how 
aerodynamics win races, why downforce is more important than 
streamlining and drag reduction, designing wings and venturis, plus wind
 tunnel designs and more.  Appraises the development process of advanced
