Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course introduces Purdue Agriculture students 
to social issues that influence the future of science innovation and the
 agriculture industry. It will particularly focus on areas of apparent 
disconnect with regard to agriculture, scientific evidence and the 
general public. In order to learn how to communicate with others on 
controversial issues, concepts of engagement will be discussed as ways 
to better understand audiences and find areas of common interest. 
Featuring guest speakers on current social issues, students will learn 
how issues impact the agriculture industry and science innovation and 
consider how to engage stakeholders regarding these concerns.

1.  Develop compelling, audience-appropriate written and video feature

coordinate topics and schedules).
2.  Plan and integrate social media strategies into your work. This 
requires critical thinking (must plan ahead to include these pieces from
 the beginning of the project, must analyze audience), communication 
(must create and schedule effective, audience-relevant posts), and 
communication (must collaborate with classmates to coordinate posts and 
schedules).
3.  Develop projects that meet a client's expectations and communication
 goals. This requires communication (with the client and source), 
knowledge (of effective interviewing and shooting principles), and 
critical thinking (to determine what audiences want to know and assess 
what they may already know).
4.  Communicate science topics to lay audiences. This requires 
communication (to translate sometimes difficult subjects in ways that 
even elementary age audiences will understand), critical thinking (to 
determine what should and should not be covered), and knowledge (of 
effective video storytelling techniques).
5.  Collaborate effectively with others. This requires communication 
(with colleagues all topics and schedules) and ethics (to be reliable 
team members who are just as responsible to each other as to 
themselves).
6.  Reflect the diversity of the community you report on. This requires 
ethics (students must ensure that their work is diverse and inclusive) 
and critical thinking (students must be aware of when their work does 
not reflect the diversity of the population they serve).

foundational understanding of communication theory, students will 
develop two primary skills: 1) a structure for the critical analysis of 
science news, 2) the skills to meaningfully communicate across 
stakeholders. The science content (GMOs, climate change, pesticide use, 
etc.) will provide the background information for analysis of the main 
focus of the course, which is in learning the communication  process for
 effectively communicating science to non-science audiences. Case 
studies and applied critical media theory will be utilized to explore 
such controversies as climate change, genetically modified foods, and 
other emergent science controversies.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course utilizes foundational research and 
commentary from scholars to track the evolution of media and our ability
 as scientists to understand and effectively communicate these issues to
 a non-science audience. Science and technology are evolving faster than
 societies ability to understand, assimilate, and make policies to 
address these increasingly complex issues. As a result, controversies 
arise over issues such as climate change, forest management, genetically
 modified foods, energy choices, genetic engineering, nanotechnology, 
water management, and agricultural practices, etc. This course covers 
the range of issues in the field of science communication including: the
 nature of science, how to translate evidence for a lay audience, media 
practices, reporting and qualifying uncertainty, human psychology and 
belief systems, information processing, and the most current research 
for messaging science. We will work together to examine the foundational
 scholarly literature in this area and how it is/ or is not reflected in
 construction of popular media. You will use this knowledge to construct
 both compelling oral science narratives, and a science story for 
popular consumption.

1.  Students will gain broad and accurate knowledge of the basic 
features of physical, cognitive, social, and psychological development 
during the middle and high school years. 
2.  Students will gain an understanding of how personal characteristics 
such as gender, socioeconomic status, and racial or ethnic background, 
as well as social contexts such as the family, peer group, school, and 
neighborhood, interact to affect adolescent development. 
3.  Students will develop the capacity to critically evaluate research 
or writings on adolescent development and behavior, based on social

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The goal of this course is to introduce students to
 a variety of theoretical perspectives of learning and development and 
how they may be used in both formal, informal and non-formal educational
 settings. This goal will be achieved through students' analysis of key 
concepts, assumptions, propositions and principles of four theoretical 
areas: (1) Foundational Learning Theory, (2) Student Development Theory,
 (3) Career &amp; Workforce Development Theory and (4) Youth Development
 &amp; Experiential Learning Theory. This course will also build on 
students' prior exposure to behaviorist, cognitive, and constructivist 
approaches of learning and development. In sum, many of the theories 
discussed in this course will provide students with a greater 
understanding of human thought and behavior that will help them become 
more effective educators, researchers and practitioners. Permission of 
instructor required.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The goal of the course is to examine social science
 theories and research designs in the contexts of agricultural and 
natural resources education, communication and engagement. Students will
 develop understanding of the chain of reasoning and create a research 
design to study a problem of interest. Students will apply the concepts 
they learned in a research methods course by critiquing research 
manuscripts and creating a rationale for a research proposal. After 
taking the course, students should have gained understanding of how 
research designs are thoughtfully and argumentatively justified to study
 a researchable problem in informal, non-formal, and formal educational 
contexts and other social science contexts. Pre-or-Corequisite: FNR
