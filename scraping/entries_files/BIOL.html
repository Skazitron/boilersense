<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course will revolve around genomics, the 
science and technology involved in determining the sequence of the 
entire DNA complement in an organism. Almost everyone has heard of the 
human genome project, but fewer are aware of the spectacular technical 
progress in this field and the fact that many thousands of genomes have 
been sequenced. Until recently, most of these have been microorganisms, 
but technological and computational progress has made it progressively 
easier and cheaper to sequence the genomes of higher organisms. This 
field may have more of an impact on your future lives than almost any 
other field of the life sciences -  mostly because it touches on all 
areas of study.  The course will focus on the impact that genomes will 
have in selected areas. It will begin with a basic understanding of the 
science and technology that gave rise to our current capabilities in 
sequencing and the fact that technology continues to provide greater 
capacity and cheaper prices. You will soon see that every field in the 
College of  Science is well represented in the science and technology. 
We will then go on to see how genomics influences many topics that 
affect our daily lives and can possibly provide answers to some critical
 questions (or at least pose better questions):  What is the basis of 
personalized medicine?  What does genomics tell us about the genealogy 
of mankind?  What impact will genomics have on our future food supply 
and our ability to feed a population of 9 billion people? What is the 
human microbiome and what does that mean to me? Similarly, what is the 
gut microbiome, the mouth microbiome, etc? What impact will genomics 
have on the development of alternative energy sources, especially 
biofuels? In every area, we will discuss the scientific challenges, but 
also the ethical and societal implications. In most cases, there is no 
one right answer, but a series of choices that can be guided by ethical 
considerations.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  The objective of this course is to provide students
 with an introductory understanding of viruses and their impact on human
 health. The course will be divided into two sections. During the first 
section, we will discuss the cellular and organismal events that occur 
following virus infection, including viral entry, replication, 
modulation of cell biology by viral proteins, the host immune response 
to infection, evasion of the immune response by viruses, and resulting 
virus-induced disease. The emphasis of this first section will be on the
 general strategies used by viruses to establish and maintain infection 
in a population. In the second section, we will discuss in relative 
detail our current understanding of select important human viruses 
including influenza, HIV, smallpox, the herpesviruses, and tumor-causing
 viruses. The objective of this section will be to understand how the 
unique aspects of each virus's biology affect the outcome of infection 
with these pathogens. In addition to virus-associated diseases, we will 
discuss potential ways that viruses may provide symbiotic benefits to 
their hosts and thereby shape the course of human evolution.  Throughout
 the course, we will emphasize societal and political aspects of 
virology and virus-derived technologies, including vaccine development, 
the use of viruses as gene therapy vectors, and the threat of viral 
bioterror of bio-error.

Specifically it will emphasize how these teams can use information, 
tools, techniques and theories from their disciplines to solve problems 
that are beyond the scope of any single discipline. In this process, the
 students will develop an appreciation of both engineering design and 
the classic hypothesis-driven experimental science as tools to solve 
complex real-world problems. This course will promote effective 
communication, systems thinking, laboratory skills, self-management and 
professional ethics. Students will learn to measure and quantify 
biological changes, analyze data (including statistical analysis) and 
interpret its meaning as it applied to the larger physiological question
 at hand. These skills will be necessary for teams to efficiently 
function in an interdisciplinary setting both in future courses and more
 importantly when they enter the workforce.

the study of molecular biological information, targeting particularly 
the enormous volume of DNA sequence and functional complexity embedded 
in entire genomes. Topics will include understanding the evolutionary 
organization of genes (genomics), the structure and function of gene 
products (proteomics), and the dynamics of gene expression in biological
 processes (transcriptomics). Inherently, bioinformatics is 
interdisciplinary, melding various applications of computational science
 with biology. This jointly taught course introduces analytical methods 
from biology, statistics and computer science that are necessary for 
bioinformatics investigations. The course is intended for junior and 
senior undergraduates from various science backgrounds. Our objective is

examples of these factors, both in human disease and animal models of 
disease. They will also complete a miniature proposal, in which they 
will identify a human disease or disease model that is subject to 
phenotypic variation. They will propose an experiment to either 
characterize the impact of a modifying factor on that disease, or a way

 factors that influence cell phenotype. All cells in a multicellular 
organism have the same set of genetic instructions, however cells have 
different phenotypes and genetically identical twins are not completely 
identical. Developmental and environmental cues impact gene expression, 
understanding how this is done is the basis of epi-(above) genetics.

history of classification systems (such as how Linnaean ranks came to 
be, and the weakness of using these ranks) will be discussed, leading 
into how modern phylogenetic methods were developed that have given rise
 to reliable methods to test hypotheses of evolutionary relationships.

<tr>
<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours:  3.00.  Epigenetics refers to heritable patterns of gene 
expression and phenotype that occur without altered DNA sequence. The 
molecular basis for many epigenetic phenomena resides at the level of 
chromatin structure. Originally thought to provide primarily a packaging
 function, the assembly of DNA with proteins to form chromatin is now 
known to be a dynamic process that is essential for proper regulation of
 gene expression. It is now appreciated that perturbed epigenetic 
regulation is associate with a variety of human diseases, such as 
cancer, and that a better understanding of this biology may reveal novel
 therapeutic approaches to treat these disorders. This course will 
introduce students to epigenetic phenomena in various organisms, ranging
 from yeast to humans, and explore the fundamental molecular biology 
that controls this level of gene regulation. Students will be exposed to
 the primary scientific literature and gain experience in presenting 
original research finding to their peers.  Permission of instructor

graduate students to the theory and practice of many commonly used 
methods. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the theoretical basis 
for these techniques, their utility in various circumstances, and their 
limitations. Although taught as a lecture, students should be able to 
take this knowledge back to the laboratory to help them in their 
research efforts. The course will be as close as possible to a 
laboratory experience without being in an actual laboratory setting. 
This course is designed to prepare students for other in-depth 
60000-level scientific courses, for their rotations, and for future 
laboratory work. Exams will be experimental in nature (e.g., design and
