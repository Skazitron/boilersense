<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  Rapidly evolving digital technologies are fueling a
 stream of innovation opportunities. To remain relevant, incumbent firms
 need to innovate and transform their business models. Digital 
strategies and innovation, however, oftentimes conflict with traditional
 managerial thinking. For example, rapidly falling coordination costs 
and the rising relevance of data make diversification patterns 
profitable that contradict today's dominant view that focused 
product-market positioning is best. This course explores the different 
effects the digital revolution has on the foundations of competitive 
advantage and thereby prepares its students to design, apply, and 
implement strategies and systems for digital innovation. Permission of 
instructor required. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Smart manufacturing is about increasing efficiency 
and eliminating pain points in your system. It's characterized by a 
highly connected, knowledge-enabled industrial enterprise where all 
organizations and operating systems are linked, leading to enhanced 
productivity, sustainability, and economic performance. Implementing 
smart manufacturing techniques requires an effective understanding of 
organizational behavior and leadership skills required for the new 
digital enterprise. This knowledge of individuals' perceptions, 
attitudes, and behavior enables leaders to choose appropriate leadership
 styles and managerial practices to increase organizational 
effectiveness and positive human outcomes. This course will provide an 
overview of organizational behavior and leadership concepts important 
for implementing change within a smart manufacturing enterprise.

<td class="ntdefault">
Credit Hours: 3.00.  This is a research-oriented course designed for 
graduate students who aim to develop and implement a scientific research
 project in the field of open innovation. They will critically discuss 
and evaluate scientific writings relevant to the new research area of 
open innovation from the fields and disciplines of innovation studies, 
information systems, and other social sciences. Through synthesis of 
theories and frameworks used in academic articles, the students will 
develop a theoretically and practically motivated research question. 
They will also implement a pilot study to examine their hypotheses. The 
Research Center for Open Digital Innovation (RCODI) in the Discovery 
Park at Purdue will offer opportunities to plan and implement individual
 questions, if students have not identified their own data source. In 
addition, the students will participate in an action-oriented research 
project in open innovation performed by the class as a group project to 
gain experience in experimental innovation research and practice. 
Prerequisites: Basic statistics (at least STAT 30100 or equivalent, STAT
