EEE 54400 - Environmental Organic Chemistry

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (AGRY 54400) The fundamental properties and processes responsible for the fate of organic chemicals in the environment, with emphasis on soil and water chemistry. Areas to be addressed will include both conceptual and theoretical aspects of processes relevant to environmental fate of contaminants; measurement, estimation, correlation, and application of the parameters most commonly used to assess various chemodynamic properties in soil-water systems. Typically offered Spring.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the fundamental properties and processes controlling the environmental fate of organic contaminants in surface and subsurface environments.
2.  Understand how variations in chemical structure change chemical behavior including solubility, volatility, acid-base speciation and reactivity.
3.  Quantify chemical distribution between soil-water, soil-air, water-air and liquid-liquid compartments.
4.  Understand and quantify how environmental and anthropogenic factors change chemical behavior and distribution in the environment.
5.  Apply partition coefficients and mass balance approaches to predict chemical distribution between various environmental compartments.
6.  Demonstrate an understanding of how abiotic and biotransformation processes affect chemical fate in the environment.
7.  Demonstrate an understanding how chemical, soil and subsurface properties impact choice of remediation strategies.
