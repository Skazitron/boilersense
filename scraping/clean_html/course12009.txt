CE 67100 - Behavior Of Metal Structures

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Study of the behavior of metal structural components and metal structural systems. The performance of civil engineering type metal structures in various loading environments is examined, and correlations between behavioral characteristics and various design specification requirements are reviewed. Primary emphasis is placed on the behavior of steel structures, although other metal systems also are discussed. Specific topics include material behavior, manufacturing processes, fatigue and fracture, bolting and welding procedures, and repair and retrofit techniques. Course material is augmented with a number of case studies. Prerequisite: CE 59100.
