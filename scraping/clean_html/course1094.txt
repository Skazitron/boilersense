AAE 33800 - Thermal Sciences

Credit Hours: 3.00.  A fundamental course covering a range of topics selected from the disciplines of engineering thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer and combustion, with an emphasis on their application to propulsion. This is an entry level course to prepare students for advanced analysis of propulsion and energy systems. Upon completion of this course, students are expected to be able to apply fundamental principles to perform thermodynamic analysis for thermophysical problems involving fluid flow, heat transfer and combustion.
