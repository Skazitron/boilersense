TLI 52600 - Digital Innovation And Transformation

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Rapidly evolving digital technologies are fueling a stream of innovation opportunities. To remain relevant, incumbent firms need to innovate and transform their business models. Digital strategies and innovation, however, oftentimes conflict with traditional managerial thinking. For example, rapidly falling coordination costs and the rising relevance of data make diversification patterns profitable that contradict today's dominant view that focused product-market positioning is best. This course explores the different effects the digital revolution has on the foundations of competitive advantage and thereby prepares its students to design, apply, and implement strategies and systems for digital innovation. Permission of instructor required. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
