ME 57900 - Fourier Methods In Digital Signal Processing

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Fundamentals of signal processing associated with Fourier analyzer systems are presented. Emphasis is on amplitude accuracy and frequency resolution properties necessary for reliable experimental methodologies in system identification, spectrum estimation, and correlation analysis. Deterministic, as well as random, data analyses are presented. Students are required to develop algorithms that significantly expand the utility of Fourier analyzer systems. Typically offered Fall.
