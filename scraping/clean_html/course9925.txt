POL 45000 - Game Theory And Strategy In International Relations

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course introduces students to the basics of game theory and its applications in international relations. The course will cover foundational concepts in game theory, including strategic rationality, best responses, normal and strategic form games, backward induction, and games of incomplete information. Students will complete problem sets to demonstrate mastery of these subjects. We will also apply these basic game theoretic tools to important problems in international relations to better understand the dynamics of bargaining, coercion, reassurance, cooperation, and other key concepts.
