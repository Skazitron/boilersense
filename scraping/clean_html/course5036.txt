ECE 20002 - Electrical Engineering Fundamentals II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Continuation of Electrical and Computer Engineering Fundamentals I. The course addresses mathematical and computational foundations of circuit analysis (differential equations, Laplace Transform techniques) with a focus on application to linear circuits having variable behavior as a function of frequency, with emphasis on filtering. Variable frequency behavior is further considered for applications of electronic components through single-transistor and operational amplifiers. The course ends with consideration of how circuits behave and may be modeled for analysis at high frequencies. Permission of Department required.
