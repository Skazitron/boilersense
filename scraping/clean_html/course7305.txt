MSE 38200 - Mechanical Response Of Materials

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course encompasses deformation-based microscopic mechanisms, including dislocation motion, diffusion, and viscoplasticity. Macroscopic mechanical response of metals, ceramics, polymers, and composites will be related to elasticity and plasticity concepts for single crystal, polycrystalline, and amorphous materials. Practical design considerations for deformation will be included as well as an introduction to fracture mechanisms. Typically offered Spring.
