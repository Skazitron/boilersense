Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on engineering design methodologies with a concern for the needs of diverse stakeholders. The course brings together topics drawn from a variety of disciplines (including anthropology, education, psychology, human-computer interaction and engineering) to introduce interdisciplinary engineering approaches to: (1) design tools, systems, and/or environments to support cognitive processes and (2) engage in human-centered and learner-centered design. The semester design project provides a context for students to apply these methods. Permission of Instructor required. Typically offered Fall Spring.
