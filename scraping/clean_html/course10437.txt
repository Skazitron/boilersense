MET 43200 - Hydraulic Motion Control Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Hydraulic feedback motion control systems, types, and applications are studied. Simulation and performance of closed loop control systems with single and multiple signal paths are emphasized. Dynamic system performance is predicted and evaluated. System parameters including accuracy, response speed, fluid compressibility effects, load disturbances, and nonlinear behavior of the components are studied. Typically offered Fall Spring.
