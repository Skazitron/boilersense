MSE 67000 - Atomistic View of Materials: Theory, Modeling And Simulations

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course students will be introduced to the fundamental physics required to describe materials in terms of electrons and atoms, learn how these processes relate to macroscopic behavior and become familiar with advanced modeling and simulation techniques that enable quantitative predictions. Students will gain hands-on experience with several simulation tools, including ab initio calculations using density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulations and other advanced modeling techniques. Pre-Requisites: BS degree in materials, mechanical, chemical, electrical or aerospace engineering or in physics or chemistry. Permission of department and instructor required.
