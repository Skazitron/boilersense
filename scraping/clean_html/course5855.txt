PHYS 56400 - Introduction To Elements Particle Physics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course brings students up to the current status of research in elementary particle physics. The focus of the course is the construction of the Standard Model with emphasis on the electroweak theory. The seminal experiments that confirmed the predictions of the Standard Model is presented. The solar neutrino problem, the search for nonzero neutrino masses, and the efforts to construct a theory which unifies all interactions, including gravity, is discussed. Typically offered Spring.
