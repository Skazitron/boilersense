EAPS 50900 - Data Analysis Techniques In Earth And Atmospheric Sciences

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Application of statistical techniques to analyze and interpret data containing substantial information about the dynamics of our planet Earth. Emphasis on fundamentals with elements of atmospheric/climate time series analysis and weather and climate extremes (necessary for understanding current research) interwoven with computer-intensive bootstrap methods (which work for complex data sets typical in geosciences).  Offered Spring.
