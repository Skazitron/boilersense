ECE 61014 - Electromagnetic And Electromechanical Component Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on the design of electromagnetic and electromechanical systems, with power applications. The course includes optimization methods, modeling techniques for design (as opposed to for simulation), and the formulation of design problems as optimization problems. Prerequisite by Topic: Knowledge of the use of field and co-energy techniques to calculate force/torque, Understanding of theory of operation of permanent magnet ac machines (brushless dc machines), basic knowledge of electromagnetic fields.
