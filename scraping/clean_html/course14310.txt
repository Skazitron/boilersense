Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is a sociological examination and analysis of the presence and significance of race and ethnicity in our society. The purpose of this course is to provide a foundation and critical framework for assessing the origins and manifestations of race and ethnicity. Race and ethnicity have historically been one basis for differentiation and stratification in the United States and other societies, and this persists today. In this course, we will examine the emergence of race and ethnicity as concepts, and how they shape our everyday lives. We will be guided by the following questions: Why do we study race and ethnicity? How and why are they relevant in our society? How do we experience race and ethnicity, and how has this changed over time? Topics include multiculturalism and diversity; media representations; racism and discrimination; colorism; racial hierarchies; immigration; and different domains of racial inequality.
