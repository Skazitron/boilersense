BIOL 48300 - Great Issues: Environmental And Conservation Biology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Concerned with the application of ecological principles to environmental issues, the course introduces fundamental ecology, emphasizing the interplay of theoretical models, natural history, and experimentation. New research developments are stressed, with the outlook for application to environmental management and restoration. Whole-biosphere issues, such as the loss of biological diversity, frame a focus at the population level to understand local and global extinction and community stability. In-depth case studies of endangered ecosystems (both temperate and tropical), with computer modeling, field trips, and discussions of policy formulation, demonstrate the range of tools and information necessary to accomplish coexistence of humans with the rest of nature.
