BME 21400 - Introduction To Biomechanical Analysis

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The goal of this course is to provide a foundation in biomechanics (analysis of forces, moments, and stresses) that will allow students to quantify the loads in the skeleton as well as design surgical tools and total joint replacements. In addition to the topics on vectors, particle equilibrium, and rigid body mechanics one would expect in a classical mechanics course, biomedical engineers must also have a working knowledge of skeletal anatomy. Consequently, anatomical descriptions and anthropometric data will be incorporated throughout the course. As part of the implant design, students will also be introduced to more advanced topics in mechanics such as Hertz contact theory, shear-lag theory, and composite beam theory.
