BME 40100 - Mathematical & Computational Analysis Of Complex System Dynamics In Biology, Medicine, & Healthcare

Credit Hours: 3.00.  An introduction to analysis of complex system dynamics that appear in biology, medicine, and healthcare. Key topics include nonlinear dynamical concepts associated with phase plane, bifurcation, stability diagram, oscillation, and chaotic systems along with concepts from discrete systems and stochastic processes. These topics are taught within the context of mathematical and computational models related to both non-communicable diseases (i.e. cancer) and communicable diseases (i.e. HIV/AIDS). Courses projects are drawn from recent literature.
