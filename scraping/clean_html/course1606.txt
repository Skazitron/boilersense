MGMT 60300 - Taxes And Business Strategy

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Provides a framework for analyzing tax planning. The framework offers an approach to tax planning and business strategy that remains useful long after the next revision of the tax code. It offers an approach that can be readily employed in an international setting. After developing the framework, it will be applied to a variety of business settings that integrate topics from accounting, finance, and economics in order to provide a more complete understanding of the role of taxes in business strategy. Two important concepts will be applied: the concept of implicit taxes (tax-induced differences in before tax rates of return) and the concept of tax clienteles (the effect of cross-sectional differences in tax rates).  Typically offered Fall Spring.
