CS 53500 - Interactive Computer Graphics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (ME 57300) The principles of computer graphics and interactive graphical methods for problem solving. Emphasis placed on both development and use of graphical tools for various display devices. Several classes of graphics hardware considered in detail. Topics include pen plotting, storage tubes, refresh, dynamic techniques, three dimensions, color, modeling of geometry, and hidden surface removal. Part of the laboratory involves use of an interactive minicomputer graphics system. Knowledge of programming required.
