PHIL 31000 - Classical Chinese Philosophy

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course, we will survey the classic works of classical Chinese philosophy (c. 600-200 BCE). We will focus on seven major philosophers (and their followers): Kongzi (Confucius), Mozi, Mengzi (Mencius), Zhuangzi, Laozi, Xunzi, and Han Feizi. We will use their work to consider topics such as: the nature and value of morality, the proper role of ritual in human life, whether human nature is good or bad, how one becomes a moral person, the proper role and function of government, and more. In addition to introducing the competing traditions of Confucianism, Mohism, Daoism, and Legalism, the course will help students to develop basic philosophical skills as they develop and defend their own views on these topics. No knowledge of Chinese is expected. Typically offered Fall Spring.
