EDCI 54800 - Teaching Mathematics To Diverse Learners

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course is designed to provide opportunities for in-service teachers to engage around issues of equity in mathematics education. Equity here is used as a broad construct intended to help us think about how to provide meaningful opportunities to learn for all the students in our mathematics classrooms. The notion of "diverse" here is also taken broadly. All students have special needs, but it is sometimes helpful to think about the needs of particular groups of students while at the same time avoiding reducing differences among students to stereotypes. Issues of diversity here include, but are not limited to race, culture, gender, disabilities, language, SES, and sexual orientation. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer
