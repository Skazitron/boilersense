Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Demonstrate subject-matter competency, including the mastery of biological theories.
2.  Demonstrate proficiency with professional skills needed by practicing biologists, including experimental design and execution, biological techniques, data collection and documentation, communication of results, and responsible conduct of science.
3.  Demonstrate the ability to discuss ethical issues in the application of biological sciences, and the impact of science on society.
4.  Demonstrate skills in critical thinking.  These skills include understanding scientific methods, solving biology-related problems, interpreting and analyzing primary literature in biology, and interpreting data in a meaningful way.
5.  Demonstrate knowledge of the path leading to specific careers in biology.
6.  Be familiar with the biogenesis, structure, and chemistry of the basic types of macromolecules important in cells: nucleic acids, proteins, and membranes, and with the organic and inorganic molecules important in cellular metabolism.
7.  Understand the role of macromolecules in cellular processes such as DNA replication, RNA transcription, protein translation, and metabolism.
8.  Understand the principles of how energy is obtained, stored and used in biological processes.
9.  Understand the chemical and physical principles that govern biochemical and physiological processes.
10.  Understand how chemical and biochemical processes relate to biological function at the molecular, cellular, organismal, and higher levels.
11.  Understand the compositions and formations of cellular structures, the molecular basis underlying cellular processes, and the links between diseases and aberrant gene functions.
