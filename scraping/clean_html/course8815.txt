ECON 55000 - Personnel Economics

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Personnel Economics applies micro- and macroeconomic theory to the workings of the labor market while maintaining a focus on incentives in the workplace. The course will investigate the determination of wages and compensation (based on a study of labor demand and supply) and the differences in these forms of payment for labor services across workers within an occupation, across occupations, and across cultures. Other topics to be considered include the connection between investments in education and training and labor market outcomes and estimates of the costs and benefits of immigration and employee turnover and discuss the impact of unions, as well as discrimination in the labor market issues. Permission of department required.
