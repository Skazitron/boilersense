BME 44000 - Computational Mechanics In Biomedical Engineering

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Teaches modeling methods for biomedical engineering problems with focus on fluid/solid mechanics. Students are introduced to the most common numerical techniques in biomedical engineering and will learn the applications of these techniques to biomechanical problems at various length scales, such as cardiac contraction and blood flow. The first half of this course focuses on modeling based on ordinary differential equation (ODE) and partial differential equation (PDE) as well as on how we integrate these equations analytically or numerically using software packages such as MATLAB. The other half focuses on fundamentals of fluid/solid mechanics and also on the application of COMSOL or similar software to solving relevant biomechanical problems.
