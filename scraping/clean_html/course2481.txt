BTNY 56100 - Survey Of Mathematical Biology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is intended to help students understand why having some kind of model is probably essential to the scientific process. The intent is to show students that they probably already have a model in their heads, and they just don't know it! Few biologists realize that when they can draw a picture of their system, or explain important pathways in words, that this is a model. From there, it isn't hard to start some basic math. The course will be a broad overview of different techniques that can be used to model biological systems. Each lecture topic in this course could itself form an entire course, so students will not complete the course as experts in mathematical modeling. Instead, the objectives are to: 1) expose students to a number of tools in mathematical modeling; 2) give students some practical experience with these tools; and; 3) develop a component of their thesis research into a model. Permission of instructor required.
