BIOL 44201 - Introductory Module: Protein Expression

Credit Hours: 2.00.  This is a project-oriented course designed to give the student exposure to laboratory research through a series of five-week modules. During this five-week introductory module, the students will learn the basics of expression, isolation, and characterization of recombinant proteins in E. coli using SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. In the first half of the course, students work initially with one recombinant DNA construct and then are given a second construct to use to identify the protein expressed. *Note: additional hours as needed for particular experiments.
