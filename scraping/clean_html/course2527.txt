CHM 26500 - Organic Chemistry Laboratory

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Similar to CHM 26300 except that a larger number and more sophisticated organic syntheses are required. The preparations are designed not only to illustrate the classical reactions discussed in CHM 26100, but to allow for an extrapolation of the principles involved to other systems.
