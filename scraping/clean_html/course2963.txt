CS 50010 - Foundational Principles Of Information Security

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course covers foundational principles relevant to information security including data structures, algorithm design, computational complexity, probability theory, number theory, and basics of cryptography. This course is restricted to CS graduate students. This course is required for students in the Master of Science in Computer Science Concentration in Information Security for Professionals Program. The course may not be used on the Plan of Study for any CS graduate students other than those in the Concentration in Information Security for Professionals program. Programming experience and computer science knowledge equivalent to that of a minor in CS. Incoming students are expected to have programming skills in at least one procedural programming languages, e.g., C,C++,Java, or Python.
