ECE 56800 - Embedded Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an introduction to the design of embedded and ubiquitous computing systems including their hardware and software architectures, design methodologies and tools, and communication protocols. The lectures are organized into three parts namely, (a) basic design principles including specification and modeling, hardware components and platforms, software organization, embedded and real-time operating systems, interfacing with external environments using sensors and actuators, and communication in distributed embedded systems, (b) advanced topics such as energy management, safety and reliability, and security, and (c) case-studies of real-world systems from a variety of embedded application domains such as biomedical devices, smart cards and RFID, networked sensors, personal computing devices, home appliances and electronics, mobile robotics, etc. In addition to hands-on programming assignments using off-the-shelf embedded system development kits, the course will feature a comprehensive project where students will design, implement, and evaluate a prototype embedded system.
