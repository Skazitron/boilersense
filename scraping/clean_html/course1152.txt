AAE 55800 - Finite Element Methods In Aerospace Structures

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to the use of advanced finite element methods in the calculation of deformation, strain, and stress in aerospace structures.  Topics include: 1-D, 2-D, 3-D, and axisymmetric elements, isoparametric element formulation, convergence, treatment of boundary conditions and constraints.  Special topics include stability, dynamic analysis, and nonlinear material behavior.  Emphasis is on the theoretical knowledge of the finite element method.  Applied experience is gained by solution of aerospace structural analysis problems through use of professional software.
