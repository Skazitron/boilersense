ECE 33700 - ASIC Design Laboratory

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Introduction to standard cell design of Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) using modern hardware description languages (HDLs). Emphasis on how to write HDL code that will map readily to hardware. Laboratory experiments using commercial grade computer-aided design (CAD) tools for HDL based design, logic simulation, automatic placement and routing, timing analysis and verification.
