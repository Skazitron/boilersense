EPCS 11100 - First Year Participation In EPICS I

Credit Hours: 1.00.  Together, Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) courses create a vertical project track under which students work in multidisciplinary teams on long-term engineering-based design projects. Projects of at least one-year in duration are intended to solve real problems that are defined in consultation with "customers" from not-for-profit community and education organizations.  EPCS courses are open to students from all disciplines; each student contributes expertise in his/her academic discipline.  Each team consists of a mix of first-year, sophomores, juniors, and seniors. Students are encouraged to participate in an EPICS project team for two or more semesters.  First-year students participating in EPCS gain insight into the specific project, and more generally, into the design and development process.  They attend planning and reporting meetings with the customer and are expected to attend all team meetings.  Under mentorship from upper level students and instructors, they perform and report upon design tasks consistent with their level of discipline expertise.  Typically offered Fall Spring.
