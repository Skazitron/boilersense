NUCL 51200 - Computers In Reactor Analysis

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The application of computational methods in reactor systems analysis. Theory behind modern numerical methods (e.g. SOR, Conugate Gradient, etc.) for solving large, sparse systems on linear equations that result from the discretization of elliptical and parabolic partial differential equations. Applications include the multigroup, multi-dimensional neutron transport equation and two-phase flow fluid dynamics. Extensive use of MATLAB, FORTRAN, and UNIX(tm). No written exams, and the majority of problem sets are performed as group projects. Knowledge of FORTRAN required. Typically offered Fall.
