ECE 61800 - Numerical Electromagnetics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The numerical solution of Maxwell's equations is studied. Numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method and the Finite Difference Method are presented for the solution of both differential and integral equations. Applications studied include: waveguides (microstrip, VLSI interconnects, optical, discontinuities), scattering (frequency selective surfaces, arbitrary scatterers), antennas, magnetics, semiconductor devices, and inverse scattering. Papers in the current literature are used. Offered every third semester. Prerequisite:  ECE 60400. Typically offered Fall Spring.
