BMS 80200 - Comparative Anatomy

Credit Hours: 4.00.  A comparative study of the body systems and the topographic relationships of the major domestic species. This course is an extension of BMS 80100 and will continue to build on anatomical knowledge so that it may be applied to multiple domestic species.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Describe major anatomical principles of structure and function and identify and describe major anatomical structures which are common among domestic species; demonstrate the ability to translate and apply that knowledge to other species.
2.  Use specific topographical and palpable landmarks in horses, ruminant species, and pigs to locate clinically important underlying structures and viscera for purposes of physical examination, imaging and other diagnostics, and therapeutic procedures.
3.  Be able to identify major and clinically important anatomical structures on skeletal and other anatomical models; radiographs; cadavers; and live domestic animals (horses, ruminant species, pigs).
4.  Identify and describe the major structural components of birds, using domestic poultry as a model, and demonstrate an understanding of structure-function inter-relationships in the avian body.
