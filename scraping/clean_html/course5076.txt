ECE 30412 - Electromagnetics II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Electromagnetics II builds on Electromagnetics I (ECE 31100) and  emphasizes time-varying electromagnetic fields. Both fundamental understanding and an appreciation for applications that span all technologies related to electrical and computer engineering are emphasized. The topics covered include:  Maxwell's equations, plane waves, transmission lines, waveguides and cavities, and antennas and radiation. Applications addressed relate to photonics, communications, and imaging and sensing. More generally, illustrations cover the basic principles on which devices and systems used every day operate.
