MA 54300 - Ordinary Differential Equations And Dynamical Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on the theory of ordinary differential equations and methods of proof for developing this theory. Topics include basic results for linear systems, the local theory for nonlinear systems (existence and uniqueness, dependence on parameters, flows and linearization, stable manifold theorem) and the global theory for nonlinear systems (global existence, limit sets and periodic orbits, Poincare maps). Permission of instructor required.  Typically offered Spring.
