Credit Hours: 3.00.  Theory of small oscillations of continuous systems. Love's equations for thin shells, reduction to special cases of shallow shells, plates, beams, etc. Initial stresses; influence of shear; thermal excitation. Initial value problems; forced vibrations; structural damping. The dynamic Green's function, impedance concepts; variational approaches.
