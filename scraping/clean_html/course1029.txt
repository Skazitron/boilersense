EAPS 60000 - Writing Successful Science Proposals

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course is designed to teach graduate students the skills necessary to successfully garner extramural graduate, postdoctoral, and project funding. Topics will include identification of funding sources and development of research objectives and strategies. Emphasis will be on writing concise fellowships and full NSF-type research proposals. Class meetings will be interactive with an emphasis on peer review. Each student will complete a quality research proposal based upon their own research. Any graduate student with a nascent idea for a science or engineering project is encouraged to enroll. We have found that this course works especially well to help newer MS or PhD graduate students develop a research project, improve communication with their advisor, and organize their research priorities regardless of whether they use this course to submit a proposal.
