Credit Hours: 4.00.  This course will provide you with a broad introduction to the field of neuroscience and how it can inform our understanding of behavior. First, we will cover neuroanatomy, synaptic communication, and plasticity. Next, we will cover neuroscience research on a range of major topics relevant to behavior: emotion, motivation, attention, learning, decision-making, and social cognition. This course will also provide a brief introduction to a variety of neuroscience research methods that are commonly used in animal and human research (e.g., electroencephalography, magnetic resonance imaging), including tutorials and live demonstrations. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall Spring.
