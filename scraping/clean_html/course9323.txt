ECET 37201 - Continuous Control Electronics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  A study of the electronic design of the elements of closed-loop analog and digital systems. Topics include characteristics of process and servo systems, analysis and design of the electronics used to acquire the process variable; condition, transmit, and receive the signal; implement a single loop control algorithm, and provide proportional power. Several sensor types and interpretation of their static and dynamic specifications are included. Controllers employed include student designed analog, and embedded microprocessor, and commercial single loop controllers. Software is used to model components and analyze open and closed-loop systems.
