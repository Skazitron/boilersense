CE 53800 - Experimental Methods In Construction Materials Research

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will introduce the student to the fundamental aspects of the computer control of experimental equipment. Emphasis is placed on the difficulties of interfacing computers and instruments. Experimental techniques for measuring important properties of construction materials are discussed. For example, techniques involving the use of strain gages, optical measurements, and measurement of properties such as pore structure and surface area are considered. Emphasis is placed on the effects of experimental techniques on the resulting measurements.
