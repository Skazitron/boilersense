ECE 57000 - Artificial Intelligence

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to the basic concepts and various approaches of artificial intelligence. The first part of the course deals with heuristic search and shows how problems involving search can be solved more efficiently by the use of heuristics and how, in some cases, it is possible to discover heuristics automatically. The next part of the course presents ways to represent knowledge about the world and how to reason logically with that knowledge. The third part of the course introduces the student to advanced topics of AI drawn from machine learning, natural language understanding, computer vision, and reasoning under uncertainty. The emphasis of this part is to illustrate that representation and search are fundamental issues in all aspects of artificial intelligence.
