AT 54200 - Aviation Fuels And Exhaust Emissions

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on aviation fuels, including engine operation with fuel, combustion principles, chemistry, exhaust emissions, and fuel testing procedures. Additionally, the topics of greenhouse gases, global warming, oil reserves, fuel costs, and other factors driving the development of alternative aviation fuels will be covered. Current research in these areas will be discussed and testing procedures will be studied. Students will research new fuels in development, and will analyze the sustainability and potential for success promised by the new technologies in comparison with existing fuels.
