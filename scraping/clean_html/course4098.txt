EEE 38000 - Environmental Chemodynamics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to chemical thermodynamics and general equilibrium processes in environmental and ecological engineering systems. Introduction to the first and second laws of thermodynamics; properties of pure substances; ideal and real gases; thermodynamic cycles and processes; heat transfer and combustion; and chemical equilibrium in aquatic solutions, including equilibria between phases and reaction equilibria. Emphasis is on understanding and conceptualizing important processes, and competency in thermodynamic calculations. Typically offered Spring Summer.
