ECE 30416 - Basics Of Engineering Optics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Basic control over propagation, reflection, refraction of optical radiation are covered. Applications to optical instrumentation such as microscopy, polarization optics such as wave plates, thin films, and holography are discussed. Geometrical optics including lenses, mirrors, prisms; Huygens' principle, Fermat principle; rays; incoherent light. Physical Optics including gratings, interferometers, diffraction elements, polarizers; Huygens-Fresnel principle. Waves, amplitude and phase, coherent light. Law of reflection and refraction, interference, diffraction, polarization.
