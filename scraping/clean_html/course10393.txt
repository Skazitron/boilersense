MET 31500 - Applied Mechanism Kinematics And Dynamics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Displacements, velocities, and accelerations are determined using graphical, semi-graphical, and numerical analyses of rotational and translational motions of common mechanisms such as linkages, cams, gears, screws, and chains as well as their loading. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Categorize and model common mechanisms, including their degrees of freedom.
2.  Determine the displacements, velocities, and accelerations in common linkages.
3.  Analyze and synthesize common mechanisms (e.g., linkages, cams, gears, screws, belts, chains, shafts).
4.  Use software in kinematic analysis and synthesis.
