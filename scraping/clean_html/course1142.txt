AAE 54600 - Aerospace Structural Dynamics And Stability

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Dynamics of continuous systems: rod, beam, frame, and plate structures. General structural principles: virtual work, Hamilton's principle, Lagrange's equation, and Ritz method for discrete approximations. Modal analysis: eigenanalysis, mode shapes, mode superposition, and complex modes. Nonlinear vibrations: phase plane, Poincare, bifurcation plots, and chaos. Stability of the motion: classification of problems, follower loads, aerodynamic loads, divergence, flutter, pulsating compression, and gyroscopic systems.
