AGR 20100 - Communicating Across Culture

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will provide students with an opportunity to understand their place in a multicultural, multiethnic, multinational country, the United States. It is designed to provide an academic overview of the field of multicultural education as it evolved to this day. The course will offer an introductory overview of the many differences that exist within all human beings. Because the diversity among individuals is endless, we cannot study all differences, but will study a sampling such as race, ethnicity, gender identity, age, social class, disability, learning styles, and religion/spiritual orientation. Issues of poverty, language, and social justice may also be examined in relationship to the above major areas of emphasis.
