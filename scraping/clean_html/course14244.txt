ENTM 50800 - Integrative Insect Taxonomy

Credit Hours: 4.00.  A multisource approach to understanding insect taxonomy, morphology, and evolution. We will compare traditional classification schemes with new hypotheses of insect evolutionary relationships based on an array of data sources. Students learn the importance of natural history collections and how to prepare insect specimens for permanent storage. We will explore insect diversity through hands-on laboratory exercises and field research.
