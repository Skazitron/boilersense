ABE 22600 - Biotechnology Laboratory I

Credit Hours: 2.00.  (IT 22600) Focuses on nucleic acid manipulation. Modules include, making a eukaryotic library, identifying clones, sub-cloning into a bacterial expression vector and verification of the clone's identity by restriction analysis and DNA sequencing. Basic laboratory techniques (solution making, buffer preparation, good safety techniques), sterile technique and compliance procedures. ABE 22600 content is primarily based on biological sciences, not engineering.
