ECE 48300 - Digital Control Systems Analysis And Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course introduces feedback computer controlled systems, the components of digital control systems, and system models on the z-domain (z-transfer functions) and on the time domain (state variable representations.) The objectives for system design and evaluation of system performance are considered. Various discrete-time controllers are designed including PID-controllers, state and output feedback controllers, and reconstruction of states using observers. The systems with the designated controllers are tested by simulations.
