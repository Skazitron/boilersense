Credit Hours: 4.00.  The design and construction of operating systems for both individual computers and distributed (networked) systems. Basic concepts and methods for managing processor, main memory, block-structured storage, and network resources are covered. Detailed examples are taken from a number of operating systems, emphasizing the techniques used in networked versions of UNIX. These techniques are applied to design improvements of portions of a simplified, networked, UNIX-based operating system; the improvements are implemented and their performance is evaluated in laboratory experiments.
