PHIL 20800 - Ethics Of Data Science

Credit Hours: 3.00.  As applications of data science permeate more aspects of our lives, new and important ethical issues are arising. However, especially because we are entering uncharted territory, reasoning clearly about the ethical implications of data science isn't easy. This course provides students with the tools for doing so, including a conceptual framework for ethical reasoning in professional settings, as well as a procedure for case-study analysis that allows students to practice employing this conceptual framework. Together, these components help prepare students to be ethical professionals and responsible global citizens.
