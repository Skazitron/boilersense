ECET 30201 - Introduction To Industrial Controls

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course examines the concepts, devices and common practices associated with control systems with a primary focus on industrial implementations. Additionally, the course provides a hierarchical examination of the implantation of control theory. Programmable logic controllers serve as the primary platform for presenting applications in interfacing and control of electromechanical and pneumatic devices. Electrical industrial safety standards are presented and emphasized throughout the course.
