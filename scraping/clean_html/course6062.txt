MFET 64200 - Programming Robotics And Cyber-Physical Systems With The Robotics Commons

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source programming platform that allows the sharing of software packages for more in-depth exploration of complex software projects involving robotics and cyber-physical systems.  The basic tools of simulation, visualization, computer vision, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), path planning, manipulation, grasping, and social interaction in robotic systems will be presented in the context of advanced projects with a publishable result. Students will develop complex, independent projects as part of the class that will result in a final report in the form of a publication-worth paper suitable for submission to an international conference. Student knowledge of a procedural programming language, familiarity with robotics, and a rudimentary understanding of linear algebra is assumed.  Prerequisites:  ECE 56900.
