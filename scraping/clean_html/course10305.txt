Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Recognize, describe and demonstrate the features, positions, and topographical locations of normal anatomical structures which are necessary for conduct of physical examination, including rectal palpation; diagnostic procedures, including contemporary imaging procedures; medical and surgical treatment of common disorders; and necropsy examination of equid animals.
2.  Identify relevant landmarks and be able to perform the most commonly conducted intra-articular injections; intra-synovial injections; and desensitization of nerves to produce of local and regional anesthesia ("nerve blocks") in horses. Explain the anatomical basis of each procedure, as well as the rationale underlying the procedures, and the level of diagnostic and therapeutic specificity of each procedure.
3.  Describe structure-function inter-relationships of clinically important organs and structures in horses, particularly as they relate to commonly encountered clinical abnormalities.
