WGSS 48500 - Feminist Perspectives On Film And Cinema And Visual Culture

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course, students investigate the gendered and intersectional meanings ascribed to or generated by popular cinematic and other mass-distributed visual texts, with particular attention to the way that visual media have impacted women's participation in public culture over the last century and a half. This course is highly conceptual, asking students to learn to recognize power relations hiding within visual entertainments and embedded within the experience of everyday life, with the goal of deepening their understanding and appreciation of the experience of spectatorship and visuality as a central element of modern American and contemporary global mass culture.
