MGMT 42000 - Consumer Analytics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course focuses on understanding how and why consumers behave the way they do. We explore behavioral and economics theories that help us better understand and predict consumers' behavior, and learn about how these theories can be applied in developing marketing strategies. The key topics covered in the course include: (i) discussion of a framework for analyzing consumers' decision making; (ii) review of relevant psychological, sociological and economics concepts; (iii) discussion of marketing research methods for studying consumer behavior. We apply the concepts covered in these topics to measure consumers' beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behavior and predict how consumers will react to different marketing strategies. Finally, we consider the application of behavior theory to the design of marketing strategies, including product design, pricing, and advertising. Typically offered Fall Spring.
