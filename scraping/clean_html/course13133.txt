Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Deduce and explain which sources of variation in heredity may apply in examples of biological phenomena.
2.  Describe units of inheritance at the population, organismal and molecular levels when given information about a trait.
3.  Distinguish single gene traits from polygenic traits and the influence of environment when given information about a trait.
4.  Describe how selection influences genetic variation at the population level within applied genetic scenarios.
5.  Correctly apply basic genetic calculations to solve classical genetic problems and explain the results.
