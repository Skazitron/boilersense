PHYS 23300 - Physics For Life Sciences I

Credit Hours: 4.00.  Physics For Life Sciences I builds upon prerequisite knowledge in college level biology, chemistry, and mathematics to present introductory physics that will be useful for applying physical principles, insights, and problem solving approaches for students with life science majors.  Content will feature the Newtonian framework with emphasis on friction, drag and viscosity, random motion and diffusion, fluid flow, the Coulomb force, molecular forces and bonding, momentum, conservation of energy, entropy, and the first and second laws of thermodynamics.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
