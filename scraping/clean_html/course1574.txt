MGMT 54600 - Decision Support And Expert Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Since a large percentage of societal and management problems can be characterized as relatively unstructured, this course explores how computers can be used to aid decision makers in dealing with unstructured, as well as structured, problems. Appropriate material from knowledge representation, artificial intelligence, and language theory is considered. Applications selected from environmental management and strategic planning in large organizations are used to illustrate theoretical ideas. Since the key computer software tool is database management, a development of the CODASYL approach to data management is presented. Typically offered Fall.
