ECE 45300 - Fundamentals Of Nanoelectronics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Nanoelectronic devices are an integral part of our life, including the billion-plus transistors in every smartphone, each of which has an active region that is only a few hundred atoms long. This course is designed to convey the key concepts developed in the last 25 years which constitute the fundamentals of nanoelectronics and mesoscopic physics, assuming a minimal set of prerequisites. Topics covered include the new Ohm's law, conductance quantization, the nanotransistor, spin valves, thermoelectricity, quantum systems and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method.
