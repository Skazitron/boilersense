FS 16300 - Introduction To Fermentation Sciences

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will provide an overview of the use of microorganisms in the food, pharmaceutical and chemical industries. The course will introduce fundamental concepts associated to the microbiological transformation of various substrates to produce desirable products such as foods, beverages, pharmaceuticals or chemical compounds. As an introductory course, the scientific principles of fermentation processes will be gradually introduced through the analysis of familiar fermented food products, such as bread, cheese, beer, wine, cocoa, coffee, etc. Once the fundamental concepts are learned, examples of advanced fermentation technology for production of pharmaceutical products and fine chemicals will be presented. Typically offered Spring.
