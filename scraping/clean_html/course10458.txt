MET 50300 - Applied Optimization

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course will introduce technology graduate students and senior undergraduates to the basic concepts of optimization methods with particular emphasis on applications in product and process design. Unconstrained nonlinear problems will be presented and solved using steepest descent and conjugate directions. Constrained problems will be solved using exterior penalty functions. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall Spring.
