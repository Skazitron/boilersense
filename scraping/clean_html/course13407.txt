Learning Outcomes: 
1. Students will strengthen their skills in critical analysis through an interdisciplinary approach to literature in a variety of genres, including drama, oratory, philosophy, and historiography.  Students will learn to use careful systematic examination of literary evidence to investigate key social and political issues in specific historical settings, while taking into account the different rhetorical frameworks provided by each text they read.

This will enable them to situate their awareness of contemporary questions about legality and justice in a wider context, by extending their knowledge of other cultures and legal/political systems.
