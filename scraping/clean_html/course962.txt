EAPS 35200 - Structural Geology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course deals with the nature and evolution of structures in rock deformed naturally by flow and fracture, as deduced from experimental, theoretical and field studies. Specific topics include: structures in three dimensions using descriptive geometry and stereonets, field measurements of rock geometry, tensors, strain and stress, the theory of brittle and plastic rock behavior, theory and field observation of folds and faults, structural analysis of an outcrop, the structure and mechanics of mountain belts. Students will be expected to show competency with using a general set skills, techniques, and tools commonly used by professional geoscientists.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Interpret geologic structures in three dimensions using descriptive geometry, stereonets, and field measurements of rock geometry.
2.  Evaluate quantitatively observations of the deformation in the crust using basic stress and strain theory, the theory of brittle and plastic rock behavior, theory and field observation of folds and faults, structural analysis of an outcrop.
3.  Recognize the structures and give a mechanical explaination for the development of mountain belts.
4. Apply these skills in the field.
