CS 57700 - Natural Language Processing

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will cover the key concepts and methods used in modern Natural Language Processing (NLP). Throughout the course several core NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis, information extraction, syntactic and semantic analysis, will be discussed. The course will emphasize machine-learning and data-driven algorithms and techniques, and will compare several different approaches to these problems in terms of their performance, supervision effort and computational complexity. Prerequisites: A background in linear algebra, calculus, statistics and probability, and completion of CS 57800 or equivalent are highly recommended. Strong programming skills in any modem language (Python, Java, C++) are required.
