BME 47000 - Biomolecular Engineering

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course covers key chemical concepts one needs in order to modify existing biomolecules, link biomolecules with other (bio)molecules, link biomolecules with inorganic entities, create composite (bio)structures, modify specific properties of biomolecules, alter/enhance biomolecule functionality. Taken together, the rational application of these biological, chemical, and engineering tools can be used to; engineer new biomolecules, design sensors for molecular detection, create diagnostic tests, develop new imaging modalities, and design and test novel biomaterials, to name a few examples.
