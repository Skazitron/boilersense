BME 45000 - Deep Learning For Medical Imaging

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Teaches the foundation of neural network (aka Deep Learning) approaches and applications to medical imaging: or how to create computable models of biological neural systems, in particular large-scale neural networks, for processing medical images and data. Drawing inspiration from neuroscience and statistics, Deep Learning introduces the basic background on neural networks, presents computable neuron models and extends to large networks of neurons. Students study deep learning with both real and artificial neural networks, along with methods of deep learning about the environment by applying back propagation, Boltzmann machines, auto-encoders, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Students will explore how Deep Learning is impacting our understanding of intelligence and contributing to the practical design of automatic medical imaging tools that are able to augment expert medical personnel, enhance diagnosis accuracy and speed, and lower health-care costs.
