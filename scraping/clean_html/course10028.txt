HSCI 41500 - Introduction To Nuclear And Radiological Source Security

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course focuses on the basic elements of nuclear and radiological source security. It examines methods for planning and evaluating nuclear security activities at the state and facility level, establishing nuclear security culture in different types of nuclear and radiological installations, and examines nuclear cyber and information security measures. Issues and approaches for nuclear security concerns, both state-level (e.g., nonproliferation and deterrence) and asymmetric concerns (e.g., nuclear smuggling and nuclear terrorism) will be addressed. Group exercises and simulations in applied nuclear security scenarios will complement lectures. This course is designed for both "technical" (engineering and science) and "non-technical" (policy) students and the interaction between students of different backgrounds is encouraged. Typically offered Fall.
