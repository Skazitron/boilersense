MET 31800 - Applied Room Acoustics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Concepts of acoustics are applied to rooms, automotive applications, speakers, musical instruments, audio electronics, and other areas of interest.  Modeling and design skills are developed through applied labs and a semester project. Lectures and mathematical exercises are combined with hands-on labs and a semester project to link abstract and physical concepts.  As part of the semester project, a special fee will be assessed to be used towards materials for the semester project. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
