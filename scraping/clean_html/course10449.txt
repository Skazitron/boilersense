MET 48200 - Mechatronics

Credit Hours: 3.00. Fundamental concepts and applications of practical mechatronics are presented, with emphasis on product design, systems integration, and functional relationships between mechanical structure, sensor data, precision actuators, power resources, embedded microcontrollers, control logic, and drives. Students gain hands-on experience with mechatronics components and measurement equipment which is applied in a team-based design-build mechatronics system project. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
