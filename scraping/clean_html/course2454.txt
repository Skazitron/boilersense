BTNY 12100 - Principles Of Plant Biology II

Credit Hours: 4.00.  This course is an introduction to fundamental biological concepts as they relate to plant biology to better prepare students for more specialized study. Lectures and laboratory exercises will cover mechanisms and processes of plant ecology, physiology and genetics. Our goal is to convey how these levels of organization all contribute to the relative success of plants within and across environments. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be made on the means by which scientific data is collected and interpreted, and key experiments performed in the lab component will be used to illustrate this process.
