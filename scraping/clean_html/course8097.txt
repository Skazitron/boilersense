CPB 88503 - Clinical Pathology I

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This is one of three concurrent courses (CPB 88501, CPB 88502, CPB 88503) in which senior veterinary students will be enrolled. In addition to clinical pathology, students must be enrolled in microbiology and diagnostic pathology (necropsy). The main goal of this rotation is to insure that each participant is at a level of competency that every graduating senior should have attained. Through a combination of self study and small group periods in a classroom as well as on a multi-headed microscope, a set of core objectives will be explored. These objectives have been chosen as a representation of basic clinical pathology skills that students should have mastered to practice veterinary medicine competently. In addition, an approved journal article or comparable piece of literature will be evaluated and summarized. An objective examination at the end of the rotation will test the student's knowledge of the objectives. Total clinic hours 43.
