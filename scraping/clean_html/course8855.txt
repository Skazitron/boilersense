ECON 64200 - Computational Economics

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  The purpose of this class is to give you a computational toolbox you can apply to economic questions. We will introduce and use numerical methods on computationally tractable problems. The goal of the course is to encourage Ph.D. students to apply these techniques to their own research. Our in-class applications will primarily be public policy and macro-oriented, by solving and simulating the problems of microeconomic agents and aggregating the results.
