ASEC 68100 - Research Design For Social Scientists

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The goal of the course is to examine social science theories and research designs in the contexts of agricultural and natural resources education, communication and engagement. Students will develop understanding of the chain of reasoning and create a research design to study a problem of interest. Students will apply the concepts they learned in a research methods course by critiquing research manuscripts and creating a rationale for a research proposal. After taking the course, students should have gained understanding of how research designs are thoughtfully and argumentatively justified to study a researchable problem in informal, non-formal, and formal educational contexts and other social science contexts. Pre-or-Corequisite: FNR 58000 or EDPS 53300 (or instructor's permission for graduate-level social science research methods course).
