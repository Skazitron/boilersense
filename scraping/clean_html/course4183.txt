ABE 42600 - Ecological Restoration Engineering

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on ecologically-based design principles to restore degraded ecosystems, specifically wetlands, stream/floodplains, and prairies. Students will identify and synthesize design elements, natural and anthropogenic stresses, and management considerations to develop resilient restoration designs. Laboratory experience provides open-ended projects, data collection, and field trips to reinforce the design process.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Identify and synthesize design elements, natural and anthropogenic stresses, and management considerations for restored streams, floodplains & riparian zones, wetlands, and prairies.
2.  Apply governing principles of ecological engineering, including biological, chemical, and physical conditions to develop resilient restoration designs.
3.  Characterize and give examples of ecological concepts, such as water and elemental cycling, vegetation succession, food web dynamics, and ecological disturbance and how they apply to monitoring restoration success.
4.  Read and extract key findings from readings.
5.  Communicate effectively in written and oral format to a wide audience.
