EAPS 53000 - Extreme Weather And Climate: Science And Risk

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Trains students in the analysis of risk due to meteorological hazards, including climate change. Focus on integrating the basics of probability theory, including calculation of hazard return periods and exceedance curves, with the fundamental physics of meteorological hazards. Hazards may include hurricanes, tornadoes, and floods.
