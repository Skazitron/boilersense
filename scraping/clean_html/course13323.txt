DANC 26100 - Contact Improvisation

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course is both a physical practice and philosophical exploration of the techniques and underlying premise of this contemporary partner dance form. CI training involves a practice of movement improvisation while developing the body's ability to attend to the effects of gravity, muscle tone, and anatomical structures on dancing solo and in partnership. While increasing their body awareness respect, sensitivity and connection, students learn about collaborative community creativity, which can be applied in other settings including design, performance, and social activism. DANC 26000 is a good preparation for this course, but not required. Course may be repeated for credit.
