MSE 53100 - Quantitative Analysis Of Microstructure

Credit Hours: 3.00.  A review will be presented of basic probability theory and statistical analysis, with particular emphasis on terms and definitions of a microstructure. The properties accessible to quantification, the basic stereological relationships and the mathematical foundations, and the microstructural tools needed to quantify the structure will be emphasized. The last one-third of the course will cover applications of quantitative metallography to problems in failure analysis, solidification, heat treatment, phase equilibria, and deformation behavior.  Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Spring.
