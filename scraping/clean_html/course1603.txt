MGMT 60000 - Accounting For Managers

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00 (West Lafayette) 3.00 (Calumet, North Central).  The two-course accounting sequence employs a user's perspective on the firm's database. First, the standard accounting model is developed into a working tool, as no prior study of accounting is assumed. Then illustrative business cases are discussed to show how external reports conform to financial contracts and public regulation. Public reports primarily directed to investors and creditors are analyzed to reconstruct the economic events and managerial decisions underlying generally accepted accounting standards.  Prerequisite: Masters student standing and Management majors only. Typically offered Fall.
