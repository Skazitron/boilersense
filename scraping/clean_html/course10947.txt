CHE 61100 - Molecular Thermodynamics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course aims at providing a systematic treatment of the microscopic foundation of thermodynamics as well as a working knowledge of the statistical formalism needed to predict microscopic properties from molecular interactions. Topics covered include kinetic theory of gases, statistical-mechanical ensembles and their correspondence with thermodynamics, ideal and imperfect gases, distribution function theory of liquids, lattice models of liquid and polymer solutions, and molecular simulation methods. Offered in alternating years.  Prerequisite: CHE 61000.
