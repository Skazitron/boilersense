MGMT 49200 - Intellectual Property Management

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Intellectual property (IP) has become a strategic opportunity for creating value for the firm. Firms are tasked with understanding how to utilize intellectual property as a competitive advantage in multiple market contexts. In the current economic environment, intellectual assets can be the largest portion of a firm's total wealth. Strategic management of these assets is very critical. Managing intellectual property is about transforming a firms ideas, know-how, etc., into learning, products, and ultimately cash flow. In Managing Intellectual Property, we examine this topic by viewing intellectual property as both a legal asset (property ownership) and business asset (value-adding). The focus of Managing Intellectual Property is on the integration of IP generation, IP protection, and strategizing functions of the firm in creating value with an IP portfolio. Concepts and frameworks discussed/developed in lecture are exercised in case studies from multiple contexts. Typically offered Fall Spring.
