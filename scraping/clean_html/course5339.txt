ECE 66300 - Compiler Code Generation, Optimization, And Parallelization

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course presents the concepts needed to design and implement production quality code generators for any of the more popular languages and families of computer architecture (including various pipelined, superscalar, and macro-parallel machines). Flow analysis and concurrency detection, as well as optimizations and loop and irregular code parallelizations, are covered in detail. Using C on ECN UNIX, each student will complete a project implementing a simple optimizer/parallelizer.  Prerequisite: ECE 56500, CS 50200 or ECE 46800 or 573000.
