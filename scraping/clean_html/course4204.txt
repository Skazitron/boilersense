ABE 52700 - Computer Models In Environmental And Natural Resources Engineering

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Offers students in environmental and natural resources engineering programs an understanding of the hydrological processes and related design skills. Principles of soil erosion by water; drainage of agricultural lands; surface runoff; flood and reservoir routing; hydrodynamic and water quality in pipe network; nonpoint source pollution; and transport phenomenon are studied. Current computer models utilized in industry for decision support are applied using case studies to further enhance the understanding of the hydrological processes. Limitations and advantages of the models are discussed.  Offered in alternate years.
