COM 49502 - Travel Writing

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Travel writing is writing about places, persons, and things in other places - also writing about how to travel, when to travel, and advice on traveling - all with the reader in mind. It's about relaying your travel experiences to others so that they may emulate them or at the very least not make the same mistakes you did. And it's writing about things in your own back yard that are exotic to everyone else - a local farmer's market, historic site, restaurant, museum. In this class, you will explore the various ways travel writers can excite and assist readers.
