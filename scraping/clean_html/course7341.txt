MSE 56200 - Soft Materials

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Soft materials are an important and diverse class of materials that share the common trait of being easily deformable by external stresses, electric or magnetic fields or even thermal fluctuations. These materials are the foundation of important technologies that are used in everyday life including ceramic and pharmaceutical processing (tablet formation), cosmetics (hand creams), cleaning products, foods (milk, mayonnaise) and bio-technologies (drug delivery). The aim of this class is to gain a fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical underpinnings of common soft materials systems and how they are used to engineer technologically relevant materials and structures. Typically offered Fall.
