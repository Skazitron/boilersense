ENGL 66900 - Introduction To Visual Theory And Visual Culture

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Visual studies is the multidisciplinary study of images, viewers, and vision. Students will be provided with an overview of the theories, practices, and histories of the visual from a variety of disciplinary perspectives and historical periods. The seminar will be organized around a series of basic questions (such as what is an image? how do images produce meaning? What do images do? what is vision?) whose responses have come to constitute the field as well as its transdisciplinarity. Readings will be drawn from seminal works in visual theory, cultural semiotics, cultural theory, intermediality, art history, media studies as well as the psychology, philosophy, and science of vision. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
