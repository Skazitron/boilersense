FNR 35910 - Spatial Ecology

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Introduction to the principles of landscape ecology and biogeography.  Landscape ecology focuses on the important relationships of landscape structure (pattern, heterogeneity) and ecological processes (movement of animals, hydrologic dynamics) and how this information is used for natural resource management.  Biogeography examines ecological patterns and processes at larger scales (generally at subcontinental to global) for the purposes of managing plants and animals of global importance. Typically offered Fall.
