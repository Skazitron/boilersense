MCMP 61700 - Molecular Targets: Neuro Function And Dysfunction

Credit Hours: 2.00.  The application of basic scientific principles from medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology, and new discoveries in biology, to the development of new drugs to treat psychiatric disorders and diseases of the central nervous system. Important examples of drug targets, and small molecules (either currently approved drugs or those under investigation) that target them, are discussed. Classes of drug target examples discussed include: G protein-coupled receptors, neurotransmitter transporter proteins, and ion channels. Processes of neurosecretion and neurodegenerative processes will also be discussed, as well as target validation and examples of the use of genetic models to identify CNS targets.  Prerequisites: MCMP 57000.  Typically offered Spring.  This course is offered in the Spring Semester of the even numbered years.
