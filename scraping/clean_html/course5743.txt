PHYS 23400 - Physics For Life Sciences II

Credit Hours: 4.00.  Physics For Life Sciences II builds upon prerequisite knowledge in college level biology, chemistry, and mathematics,  as well as on Physics of Life Sciences I,  to develop an understanding of how energy, entropy, enthalpy, and Boltzmann distributions affect the dynamics of living systems, of how electric fields and potentials are applied to fluids and membranes, and how the physics of harmonic oscillators, waves, sound, optics, photons, and quantized states are relevant to biological systems and the tools used for their study.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
