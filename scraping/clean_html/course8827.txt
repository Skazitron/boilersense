ECON 58400 - Experimental Economics

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  This course introduces you to the experimental methods used by economists to study human behavior. These methods analyze data collected in controlled laboratory experiments. Throughout the course, we will discuss different types of experiments that have been extensively researched by experimental economists. To help introduce and motivate each topic, you will participate in weekly synchronous experiments with your classmates over the internet. You will then complete an assignment analyzing the data generated by your class in the online experiment. The following lecture will provide an overview of the theoretical framework and experimental predictions. We will also discuss commonly observed behavior and any relevant explanations for such behavior.
