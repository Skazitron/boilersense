IT 53000 - Biometric Technology Test Design, Performance, and Evaluation

Credit Hours: 3.00. An introduction of methods of designing biometric testing, performance, and evaluation analyses. Specifically, methods of evaluating fingerprint, face recognition, iris, and voice recognition data are explored using ROC curves, CMC, Rank statistics, and DET curves. The course examines testing requirements from submission of IRB documents to the final analysis. A component of comparative analysis within modalities is included. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
