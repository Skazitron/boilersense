CS 57800 - Statistical Machine Learning

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This introductory course will cover many concepts, models, and algorithms in machine learning. Topics include classical supervised learning (e.g., regression and classification), unsupervised learning (e.g., principle component analysis and K-means), and recent development in the machine learning field such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and Gaussian processes. While this course will give students the basic ideas and intuition behind modern machine learning methods, the underlying theme in the course is probabilistic inference.
