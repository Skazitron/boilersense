IPPH 68000 - Pharmacokinetics And Biopharmaceutics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the study of the time course of the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of a drug, compound or new chemical entity (NCE) after its administration to the body. Biopharmaceutics examines the relationship between the physical/chemical nature of a drug, the dosage form and the route of administration on the rate and extent of systemic drug absorption. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutics properties of an NCE are critical to its selection as a lead candidate in a drug discovery program, its use as a functional research tool, and its use as a therapeutic agent. This course will be an overview of the development of pharmacokinetic principles, including guidelines for conducting clinical studies, and equations required to characterize the disposition of drugs and their metabolite(s). Students will develop the ability to probe the mechanisms and physiological processes responsible for ADME. Pharmacodynamics, the relationship between drug concentration and effect, and the issues surrounding stereospecific PK will presented. Prerequisites: Admission to the IPPH graduate program and at least one course in pharmacology and one course in mammalian or human physiology. Permission of instructor required. Typically offered Spring.
