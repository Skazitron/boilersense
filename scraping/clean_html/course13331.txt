DANC 37800 - Survey Of Concert Dance History

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is a broad survey of concert dance history predominately in the 20th and 21st century in Western cultures. The direct relationship and influence of the culture, training, choreographic, and performative records of dance practices, to socio-political ideologies of gender, race, sexuality, and national identities will be the area of investigation. Students will read, watch, research and actively participate in discussion regarding important dance figures, movements, eras, and their social and cultural reverberations. Dance's relationship to other art practices throughout history will also be a subject of lecture and discussion.
