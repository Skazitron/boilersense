Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Master a medical terminology for parasites, by using the language of medicine, pathology and parasitology in both written and oral forms.
2.  Understand general aspects of veterinary parasitology including life cycles, pathogenesis, diagnostic methods, and anthelmintic drugs.
3.  Explain how the important parasites are transmitted and maintained in nature and/or domestic environments.
4.  Identify the types of clinical problems and pathology caused by the various parasites and be able to explain the basic pathogenesis of these changes for the parasites. Correlate clinical and gross and microscopic pathologic findings due to these parasites.
5.  For important parasites, predict the clinical presentation if given the pathologic lesions. Identify the expected pathologic lesions if given the clinical presentation.
6.  Recognize important parasites grossly and/or microscopically, focusing especially on clinical parasitology diagnostics, i.e. recognition of helminth eggs, larvae, cysts, oocysts, etc. in fecal or other samples.
7.  Explain the methods and rationale for treatment and control of parasitic infections.
8.  Understand the zoonotic importance of certain parasites, and how they are dealt with from a veterinary public health standpoint.
9.  Develop diagnostic thinking skills, computer literacy skills, and learning skills.
10.  Recognize the importance of a solid knowledge of parasitology in the practice of veterinary medicine and surgery, and other fields of veterinary medicine.
