BIOL 53601 - Biological And Structural Aspects Of Drug Design And Action

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (BCHM 53600) This course is aimed at expanding students' fundamental interests in biology, chemistry and biochemistry to how drugs work. The course will provide an overview of the modern day drug discovery pipeline and an in-depth look at the basic biology, structure, and mechanisms-of-action behind marketed therapeutics. The course will start with a historical account of the discovery of natural product drugs such as aspirin and penicillin and will then venture into the modern day era of drug discovery including structure-based drug design. We will explore different classes of antibiotics, antiviral, and anti-cancer drugs and their targets including small molecule drugs and modern biologics-based drugs.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.   Understand and communicate the site and mechanism-of-action of a drug.
2.   Understand and communicate the relationship between the pharmacologic mechanism and the therapeutic use of a drug.
3.   Understand and communicate the scientific basis for the therapeutic use of a drug.
4.   Predict, verbally or in writing, the biological response, if any, from a given chemical structure.
5.   Understand and communicate the relationship between the structural features of a compound and the physicochemical properties that might influence biological response or the design of new
      agents.
6.   Predict, verbally or in writing, the biochemical mechanism-of-action of a biologically active substrate or compound from its chemical structure.
7.   Communicate and describe the relationship between the chemical structure of a biologically active compound and the receptor or active binding site, using enzyme or receptor models.
8.   Predict, verbally or in writing, the biological response resulting from the chemical alteration or biochemical pathways.
9.   Discuss the relationship between in vitro reaction mechanisms and the structural features that alter the in vivo biotransformation of a drug.
10. Understand and communicate the pathophysiologic processes associated with a particular disease state, and how they might be affected by drug therapy.
