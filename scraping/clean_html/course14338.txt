SOC 34400 - Environmental Sociology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course introduces students to the interplay between human societies and environmental problems. The most challenging environmental problems we face are rooted in human activities. Why do some environmental problems come to be viewed as problems and others do not? How did environmental problems come to be viewed differently by different social groups? How do we motivate the necessary social support to address these problems? Answers to these kinds of questions and others are what we will consider in this class. Typically offered Spring.
