BIOL 48100 - Eukaryotic Genetics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course presents the fundamental concepts of classical and modern molecular genetics in eukaryotic systems, using examples from the model genetic organisms, yeast, Drosophila, Caenorhabditis, Arabidopsis, maize, mice and humans. These concepts are applied to solving problems of genetic analysis. Recent advances in developmental, cancer, and behavioral genetics and genomics, and applications of genetic technology, are used to demonstrate the impact that modern genetics makes at the cutting edge of biological research.
