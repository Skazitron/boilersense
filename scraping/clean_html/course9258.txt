ECET 22900 - Concurrent Digital Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course establishes a foundation for concurrent digital systems. Common methods of describing digital circuit operation are studied along with the techniques for translation between any two methods. Basic building blocks of digital systems are defined and applied. Analysis techniques for combinational and sequential logic circuits or subsystems are covered. Computer-based development tools, programmable logic devices, and technical reference sources are used to build, test, and evaluate digital systems.
