PSY 51300 - Introduction To Computational Cognitive Neuroscience

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Computational cognitive neuroscience is a new field of study that lies at the intersection of computational neuroscience and the similar fields of machine learning, neural network theory, connectionism, and artificial intelligence. Like computational neuroscience, computational cognitive neuroscience strives for neurobiological accuracy and like connectionism, a major goal is to account for behavior. Covered topics include feature extraction / optimization, connectionism, computational neuroscience, and computational cognitive neuroscience applications. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall Spring.
