MA 30100 - An Introduction To Proof Through Real Analysis

Credit Hours: 3.00.  An introduction to abstract reasoning in the context of real analysis. Topics may include axioms for the real numbers, mathematical induction, formal definition of limits, density, decimal representations, convergence of sequences and series, continuity, differentiability, the extreme value, mean value and intermediate value theorems, and cardinality. The emphasis, however, is more on the concept of proof than on any one given topic. Typically offered Fall Spring.
