HORT 55100 - Plant Responses To The Environment

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Future agricultural production and the environment will encounter multifaceted challenges from global climate change, heat and drought incidence and severity, and limited land and resources. An understanding of how plant responds to these changes is essential to develop new technologies and systems approaches to mitigate the negative impacts and enhance agricultural crop productivity. This is an advanced plant biology course covering the present state of understanding of phenological, physiological, and molecular and genetic mechanisms and processes by which plants acclimate to transient and chronic environmental extremes. Typically offered Fall.
