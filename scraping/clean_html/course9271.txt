ECET 27400 - Wireless Communications

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The theory and techniques of wirelessly sending information (voice, music, data) from one location to another is studies from a systems point of view. This includes a signal analysis, modulation techniques, transmitters, receivers, low noise amplifiers, and filters in the RF frequency spectrum. In addition, special topics of current interest are introduced. This course incorporated a student-based communication design and analysis laboratory.
