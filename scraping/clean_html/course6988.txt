BCHM 61000 - Regulation Of Eukaryotic Gene Expression

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will provide students with a basic understanding of gene expression mechanisms with a s specific focus on newly emerging topics. This course will be taught from current primary literature, using a textbook as a background resource. Topics will include transcription, messenger RNA decay, microRNAs and connections between gene expression steps. Students will learn how to read and interpret scientific literature through class presentations, discussions and take home assignments. Additionally, students will gain experience in developing and testing hypotheses within the class topic areas and writing a research proposal. Prerequisites: BCHM 56100 and 56200, or BCHM 60501. Lack of these prerequisites will require approval by the instructor.
