MET 41100 - Introduction To The Finite Element Method

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The finite element method is introduced, with emphasis on modeling and interpretation of results. Linear static problems are solved using commercial FEA software, and FEA results are verified through laboratory tests and/or theoretical calculations. Topics include trusses, frames, plane stress/strain, torsion, 3D structures, buckling, and natural frequency/mode shape analyses. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
