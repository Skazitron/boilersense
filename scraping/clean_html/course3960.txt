BME 20700 - Bioinstrumentation And Circuit Theory

Credit Hours: 3.00. Introduction of laboratory instruments used to measure physiological events. Stimulation and conduction of electric signals within the mammalian nervous system and other excitable tissues are demonstrated. Fundamental circuit elements and concepts include resistance, capacitance, inductance, op-amps, impedance, voltage, current, power, and frequency. Fundamental analog measurement concepts include adequate bandwidth and amplitude and phase linearity. An integrative design project emphasizes the practical aspects of quantitative physiological measurements. Students are introduced to programming (using Python) to deepen the understanding of the basic concepts and learn basic skills in data processing.  SPICE software will be used throughout the course to design/simulate various analog circuits.
