MCMP 51400 - Biomolecular Interactions: Theory And Practice

Credit Hours:  1.00 to 4.00.  Theory and applications of biophysical and bioanalytical methods for the identification and qualification of biological and pharmaceutical samples.  Methods to be discussed include chromatography, electrophoresis, optical spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, electrochemical methods, radiochemical analysis, ultracentrifugation, calorimetry and surface plasmon resonance.  Physical measurements, such as binding equilibrium, kinetics and macromolecular structure will be discussed.  While fundamentals of each technique will be discussed, a major focus will be on the application and integration of presented methods for the analysis of biological problems.  The course will be organized into four general topic areas around the theme of medicinal analysis, and variable credit will be available based on a student's interest in the four topic areas (i.e., 1 credit per topic area).  Students should register for 1 credit hour, and the variable credit option will be discussed and determined at the first class period.  Permission of instructor required.  Typically offered Spring.
