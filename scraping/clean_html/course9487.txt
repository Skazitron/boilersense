Credit Hours: 4.00.  Advanced study of the biology and ecology of fishes. In particular, the course covers aspects of the morphology, physiology, development, behavior, evolution, and diversity of fishes throughout the world. The relationship of fishes to the physical, chemical, and biological features of the environment in both natural and perturbed aquatic ecosystems will be explored. An emphasis will be placed on diversity in morphology, behavior, feeding, and reproductive strategies as they relate to individual, population, community structure, and anthropogenic effects. Typically offered Spring.
