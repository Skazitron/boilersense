Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Explain how key mechanical, biological, and electrical parameters produce signals that can be sensed by a transducer. 
2.  Select transducers for each of the parameters above to meet measurement requirements. 
3.  Design, simulate, build, and verify the performance of amplifiers, filters, and signal conversion circuits appropriate as interfaces to the transducers above. 
4.  Create software that accesses, reduces, and displays data from these converts.   
5.  Calculate a full system error budget.
