MSE 56700 - Polymer Synthesis

Credit Hours: 3.00. Analyze properties of polymers and correlate them to chemical structure. Apply methods and mechanisms of polymer chemistry to industrial and laboratory synthesis. Examine the kinetic and design factors that control polymer structures. Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Spring.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Student will understand, predict and design polymer properties based on polymer structure and how and why certain reactions take place through mechanistic means. 
2.  Be able to produce a polymer structure based on known reactants and retrosynthetically design a chemical route to a variety of polymer structures.
3.  Intuitively grasp the kinetic factors involved to predict such things as molecular weight, polydispersity, and others. 
3.  Understand polymer chemistry in relation to everyday materials and why industrial practice is as is.
