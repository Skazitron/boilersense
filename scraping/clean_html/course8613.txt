CEM 53200 - Infrastructure Planning

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides the student with an in depth understanding of the issues related to infrastructure planning, engineering, and economics. The focus will be on the prioritization, stewardship, management and decision-making roles within the engineering division of a large public works agency. Various infrastructure planning concepts will be reviewed and discussed. Numerous case studies will be described and discussed, which will demonstrate that in order to plan and implement a successful public works project, many controversial issues must be faced and difficult problems must be solved. Decision-making at agency and other levels of government will be discussed with respect to reports prepared by planners covering engineering feasibility, environmental and social impact assessments, and financial and economic analyses. Evolving modern planning issues will be introduced and discussed, including sustainability; environmental economics; environmental justice; uncertainty and risk-benefit analysis; partnerships with private entities versus total privatization; and the optimum staff-mix utilization in-house versus outsourcing.
