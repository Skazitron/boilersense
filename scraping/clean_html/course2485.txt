BTNY 61300 - Advanced Plant Pathology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course makes an exhaustive attempt to dissect the nature of plant disease and resistance mechanisms in plants. Special emphasis is placed on emerging concepts and paradigms that underlie a wide variety of plant-pathogen interactions, and how the knowledge gleaned from these studies is being used to devise effective and environmentally safe strategies of plant protection. It is expected that students have knowledge in genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry, and plant pathology.
