MET 16000 - Analytical And Computational Tools In MET

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The skills needed to solve technical problems in mechanical engineering technology are developed. Instruction is given in analytical and computational problem-solving techniques. The electronic calculator, the factor-label method of unit conversions, engineering graphs, and the computer are used to solve problems. Computer emphasis is on spreadsheet analysis, graphics, and generation of technical reports through the integrated use of software packages.  Credit will not be granted for MET 16000 and MET 16200 or MET 16300. Typically offered Fall Spring.
