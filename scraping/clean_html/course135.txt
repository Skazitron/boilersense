ENGL 22400 - Literature, Money, And Markets

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course explores the interconnections among markets, business and its management, and literature. It examines representations of traditional markets (industry, finance, and global trade) as well as alternative markets (the market in bodies, the black market, and the digital marketplace economy). The course will present a wide-ranging survey of canonical texts, orienting the reader as to how classics from Chaucer to Dickens are engaged in the business of thinking about business. But it will also engage with alternative viewpoints and contemporary concerns about business practices, literature, and individual consciousness in the techno digital age. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
