AGEC 62500 - Macroeconomic Issues In Agriculture

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Studies the nature and importance of linkages between agriculture and the macro economy, and examines theories and methods used to establish or quantify these linkages in agricultural models. Extensions of macroeconomic accounting and theory into an open economy are explored by examining attempts by agricultural economists to estimate macroeconomic linkages and build them into commodity models, and considering consequences of implicit and explicit macroeconomic assumptions in much of our work. The changing role of agriculture in an economy under structural transformation will be key to understanding these linkages and how they evolve, as shown in several new developments seeking to explain both recent events and policy history in macro-theoretical frameworks consistent with observed empirical regularities.
