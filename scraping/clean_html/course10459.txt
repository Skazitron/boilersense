MET 50700 - Organizational Environmental Quality

Credit Hours: 3.00. The principles of organizational environmental quality characterization, regulatory management, and engineering control will be covered. The health effects realized by significant exposures to potential indoor and outdoor organizational environmental pollutants from all media types (water, soil, air, artifact) will be elucidated. A special emphasis will be placed on how to develop a sound foundation for designing appropriate engineering control technologies such as ventilation and filtration. Permission of department required. Typically offered Fall Spring.
