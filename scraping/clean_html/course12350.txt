AGEC 63000 - Urban And Regional Economics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The literature discussed in this urban and regional economics course covers theoretical texts, conceptual as well as statistical, and empirical applications in order to introduce the student to the economist's view on spatial variation in economic outcomes. This ranges from coverage of the theory of industrial location choice, through theoretical and empirical analysis of the spatial distribution of economic activities (agglomeration theory, industrial clusters, central place theory), to theoretical and empirical explanations for the spatial structure of cities, the working of regional labor markets and migration. The course covers various empirical tools utilized in spatial data analysis (spatial econometrics) and modeling of regional economies and their interrelations (interregional input-output analysis). Prerequisites:  AGEC 20300 or ECON 34000 or ECON 51100.
