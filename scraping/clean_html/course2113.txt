ME 37500 - Measurement And Control Systems II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an introduction to modeling electrical, mechanical, fluid, and thermal systems containing elements such as sensors and actuators used in feedback control systems. Modeling techniques based on physical laws and principles are used to generate subsystem and system transfer functions. Closed-loop system analysis will include the use of proportional, integral, and derivative elements to control system response. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
