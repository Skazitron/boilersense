ENGT 50900 - Applied Computational Methods

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This class covers the mathematics typically needed for research in engineering technology and is especially suited to the needs of ENGT student. The class includes basic calculus, introductory numerical methods, implemented in MATLAB, and elementary linear algebra. It uses relevant, practical problems to teach concepts and provides the students with actionable information. The starting point is graphical and numerical solutions of systems of non-linear algebraic equations. The class progresses to simple ordinary differential equations. Pre Requisite:  Six credits of undergraduate classes in technical mathematics, focusing on calculus.
