PUBH 52500 - Statistical Methods For Public Health Evaluation

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an overview of the statistical methods required to evaluate the effectiveness of public health intervention or prevention programs and policies. The course introduces a range of quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods research designs and the application and tailoring of these designs to evaluations. In addition, we will focus on categorical data analysis methods, which are often necessary for evaluation projects. You will collaborate to conduct an evaluation, develop a report with your findings, and present your findings. The course is intended for graduate students in public health; however, it may be of interest to students in social work, nursing, education, criminal justice, psychology, and other related fields. Permission of department required.
