ECE 61500 - Nonlinear Optics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  An in-depth study of nonlinear optics. After a review of linear effects, several nonlinear optical processes and applications are discussed. These include electro-optic switches and modulators, harmonic light generators, sum and difference frequency mixing, parametric amplifiers and oscillators, and phase conjugate mirrors. Discussions of nonlinear spectroscopy include topics such as two-photon absorption, saturation spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and double-optical resonance measurements. Photon echoes and other transient effects, and surface effects are also discussed. Offered in alternate years. Prerequisite:  ECE 55200, 60400.
