WGSS 43000 - Women In African History

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (HIST 43000) African women's history is rich and deeply layered.  In this course, we will examine the social, political, economic, religious, and cultural experiences of women living in Africa.  Although we look at women in the pre-colonial and slave trade eras, the focus will be on women during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.  Much of our reading and discussion will consider not only women, but also gender as we think about women's interactions with men and children.  This course is concerned with the historical forces shaping African women's lives, as well as with ways in which women have been active agents in the making of their own histories.  Students can expect to engage with a number of different types of texts (e.g. firms, novels, scholarly analyses, and primary sources.)  Typically offered Fall, Spring.
