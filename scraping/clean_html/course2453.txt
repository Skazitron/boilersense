BTNY 12000 - Principles Of Plant Biology I

Credit Hours: 4.00.  This course is the first of a two-semester series that provides an introduction to fundamental biological concepts as they relate to plant biology to better prepare students for more specialized study. Lectures and laboratory exercises will cover mechanisms and processes of plant diversity, anatomy, morphology, cell biology, growth and development. Our goal is to convey how these levels of organization and processes contribute to the relative success of plants within and across environments. Throughout the course, an emphasis will be placed on how scientific data are collected and interpreted, and key experiments performed in the lab component will be used to illustrate this process.
