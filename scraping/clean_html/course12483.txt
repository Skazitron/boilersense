MCMP 61800 - Molecular Targets: Cancer

Credit Hours: 2.00.  The application of basic scientific principles from medicinal chemistry and molecular pharmacology, and new discoveries in biology, to the development of new anti-cancer drugs. Important examples of drug targets and small molecules (either currently approved drugs or those under investigation) that target them, are discussed. Classes of drug targets discussed include: kinases, small monomeric G proteins, prenyltransferases, transcription factors, nuclear receptors, cell cycle proteins, cytoskeletal proteins, and topoisomerases.  Prerequisites: MCMP 57000.  Typically offered Spring.
