PHRM 82800 - Dosage Forms I

Credit Hours: 3.00. The purpose of Dosage Forms I is to provide a foundation in the basic concepts of pharmaceutics that are the foundation of drug delivery. The course begins by presenting the molecular basis for aqueous and lipid solubility of drugs, pharmacokinetic principles that are related to dosage forms, mechanisms by which excipients or manufacturing processes affect bioavailability, and chemical kinetics applied to the shelf-life of dosage forms. The pharmaceutics principles are then applied to successively more complex liquid dosage forms: solution, emulsion, and suspension. The excipients that are required to prepare the dosage forms: buffers, preservatives, emulsifiers, suspending agents, wetting agents, etc. and the method of preparing each dosage form in both a compounding and manufacturing setting are covered. Typically offered Fall.
