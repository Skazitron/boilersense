EDPS 32700 - Classroom Assessment

Credit Hours: 1.00 to 3.00. Evaluating the impact of instruction on student performance is one of the most important skills for an educator. Effective teachers ask themselves, "How do I know if students are truly learning? Are they meeting educational objectives in the content area?" Using well-chosen assessment approaches, teachers can address these questions. In this course, students will acquire assessment literacy: the ability to gather accurate information about student achievement, and use that information to make instructional decisions that will improve learning. Course activities will focus on assessment tasks relevant to P- 12 classroom settings. Typically offered Fall Spring.
