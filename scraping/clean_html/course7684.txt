BIOL 66300 - Seminar Methods And Professional Development II

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course is a continuation of BIOL 66200 and expands the introduction for incoming graduate students to methods of seminar presentation and critique and to various guidelines for professional development during their graduate school experience. Topics include seminar topic selection and 20-minute seminar design, tutorials on electronic services at the PU Library and Citation Management programs, and evaluating classmate presentations. Using the skills learned the previous semester, each student is required to make a 20-minute PowerPoint presentation to the class, based on a pre-approved topic of their choice. The speaker is asked questions and the presentation receives written evaluations by all members of the class. Each student practices with the course instructor prior to the public presentation. The course also continues to socialize the incoming cohort of students among themselves and with more senior students in the broad range of research disciplines available.
