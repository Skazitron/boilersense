This course also provides a summative assessment of the students’ knowledge in the final two years of their education. Due to the highly complex nature of the cases, students must use past clinical experiences and knowledge learned in multiple courses in order to successfully present cases and to respond in thoughtful ways that contribute to the online learning environment. Permission of department required; must also be currently enrolled in SLHS 57900 or SLHS 67900 completing an audiology externship.
