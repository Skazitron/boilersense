CNIT 37000 - Introduction To Cryptography

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Cryptography is an essential component to protect information in cyber systems. This course introduces the inner workings of cryptographic primitives and how to correctly use them. Specifically, the course covers cryptographic algorithms, protocols and techniques. The algorithms illustrate the art of encryption and secure hashing. The cryptographic protocols will expose the students to the world of building trust in an untrusted environment. Cryptographic techniques used in key management and algorithm choice will be explored.
