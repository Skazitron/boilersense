ECE 30415 - Fiber Optics And Lasers Laboratory

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This laboratory course exercises in lasers, modulation of laser beams, fiber components and systems. It covers some simple optical measurements like Power and beam spot measurement of Gaussian beams. Students learn about lens-pinhole spatial filters and beam expanders. Fourier transform, convolution and correlation are covered. Characteristics of LEDs and ILDs are shown. Students become familiar with optical fibers related experiments like Fiber-optic microbend intensity sensors, Electrooptic modulation, Fiber optic Mach-Zehnder interferometer etc. Students also learn how to build laser systems based on the knowledge acquired from previous labs and with some simple set up. Finally there is a final project where students can design a practical optical instrument based on their knowledge from the lab.
