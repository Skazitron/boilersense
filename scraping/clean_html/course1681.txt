Credit Hours: 2.00.  The Internet and other emerging technologies have enabled new ways for companies to organize their businesses. Companies are also increasingly dealing with digital information that is different in many ways from other goods and services.

We will use lectures, cases, class discussions, games, and team projects to examine a variety of topics including pricing and competition on the Internet, cross-channel competition and marketing, "Long Tail", pricing of digital information, bundling, versioning, network effects, platform, and a variety of other topics. Fundamental economic principles will be illustrated using business case studies. At times, we will also discuss emerging digital technologies, business models and industry structures.
