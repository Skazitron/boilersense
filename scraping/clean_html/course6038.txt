Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Describe the convergence of the physical and digital worlds, technology, and standards of IIoT-aided modeling and simulation. 
2.  Implement process data modeling and application to various types of plant data (drives, pumps, production lines) using real-time, historical, and event-based data. 3.  Develop digital/virtual-cloud representation models to be mirrored onto physical manufacturing systems. 
4.  Create digital twin (DT) models using data from IIoT devices for monitoring and automating control of smart connected assets.  
5.  Construct DT-oriented simulation model for IoT-aided manufacturing system for applications in productivity, reliability, efficiency, and predictive maintenance operations. 
6.  Develop application of augmented reality and manufacturing model proxies in diagnostic and troubleshooting operations.
