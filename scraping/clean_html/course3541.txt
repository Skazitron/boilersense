COM 46499 - Professional Practice Parallel Co-Op Semester IV

Credit Hours: 0.00.  Cooperative Education (Co-Op) is an academic program with oversight provided by assigned Faculty Coordinators who serve as the Instructor for participating students. Parallel Co-Op program participants are undergraduate students, who work part-time (more than 11 hours per week and less than 30 hours per week) in paid positions during the academic year terms (fall and spring semesters) for an employer with a local business or office. During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students work in part-time or full-time positions at any location offered by the employer.  A minimum of a one-year commitment is required for Parallel Co-Op students and employers. During the academic year, Parallel Co-Op students register for 6 to 11 credit hours of academic course load, and also for an appropriate 0-credit hour Parallel Co-Op course that carries half-time student status to recognize the academic impact of the experience. The combination of both academic courses and Parallel Co-Op course registrations provides students with full-time status. During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students register for a zero-credit hour Parallel Co-Op Summer course that carries full-time student status. Permission of Instructor required.
