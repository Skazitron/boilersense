Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Develop basic knowledge of clinically relevant bacterial and fungal agents of disease in animals, including taxonomy, virulence factors, and pathogenesis (including transmission), with less emphasis on diagnosis and treatment (though these will be discussed). The course includes a brief introduction to antimicrobial chemotherapy and judicious use of antimicrobial agents.
2.  Learn which agents are considered zoonotic or of other public health importance (e.g. foodborne pathogens, bioterrorism potential, etc.).
3.  Practice basic microbiology laboratory techniques.
