OBHR 64700 - Teams, Technology And Human Capital

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Human capital-people and their collective knowledge, skills and abilities-is the lifeblood of organizations.  Today's managers must be equipped to leverage technology effectively, which requires an understanding of how technology alters the social dynamics of work.  Drawing on an interdisciplinary, socio-technical framework, this course develops an understanding of the interplay between information and communication technologies and human capital, and applies this knowledge to timely work topics, including change management, knowledge management, virtual and alternative work structures, ethics and fairness, distance leadership and control, security, privacy, and trust.  Prerequisite: Master's student standing and Management majors only. Typically offered Fall Spring.
