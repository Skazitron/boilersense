CS 43900 - Introduction To Data Visualization

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course offers an introduction to the fundamentals principles, design strategies, and techniques needed to visually communicate, explore, and analyze data. The course focuses primarily on the visual representation of inherently non-spatial data (e.g., tables and spreadsheets, graphs and networks, trees, text, and time series), but also considers the visualization of maps and of data in geospatial context. The course project fulfills the Capstone requirement for Data Science majors who have previously completed CS 37300.
