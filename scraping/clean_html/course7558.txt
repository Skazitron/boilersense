BIOL 44212 - Microscopy And Cell Biology

Credit Hours: 1.00.  In this five-week module, students will learn how to prepare specimens for viewing by fluorescence microscopy. Specimens include mammalian tissue culture cells and zebrafish embryos. The emphasis will be on the staining of the cytoskeleton in these preparations, utilizing antibodies and fluorescence probes. The specimens will  be viewed by wide-field and confocal  laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Images will be acquired, processed and analyzed by modern computational methods. Students will learn the basics of cell culture, immunocytochemistry, fluorescence  microscopy, digital image processing and data analysis. At the end of the course, students prepare a PowerPoint presentation of their images and data.
