PHYS 17200 - Modern Mechanics

Credit Hours: 4.00.  Introductory calculus-based physics course using fundamental interactions between atoms to describe Newtonian mechanics, conservation laws, energy quantization, entropy, the kinetic theory of gases, and related topics in mechanics and thermodynamics.  Emphasis is on using only a few fundamental principles to describe physical phenomena extending from nuclei to galaxies.  3-D graphical simulations and numerical problem solving by computer are employed by the student from the very beginning. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
