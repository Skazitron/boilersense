BTNY 20700 - The Microbial World

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course delivers a broad synthesis of microbiology, discussing all taxa of the microbial world. The course also discusses a wide range of subjects related to microbiology, including medical microbiology, but it has a strong emphasis on the botanical and environmental sciences. One particular characteristic that separates it from other microbiology courses is the reduced emphasis upon bacteriology, with discussions of the protists and viruses and, especially of the fungi, occurring in greater detail than the other general microbiology courses available.
