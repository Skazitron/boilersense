ECET 33700 - Continuous Systems Analysis And Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This is an advanced course in continuous systems analysis and design. Systems may include RCL circuits, op amp circuits, and DC permanent magnet motors. Systems analyses using differential equations and Laplace Transform techniques are developed, culminating in active filter and closed loop PID system design. Software tools, circuit simulation, and advance calculators are used to solve differential, integral, and differential equation problems.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Analyze first and second order circuits using differential equations and Laplace transforms.
2.  Analyze and identify the output response of first-order and second-order systems with regards to gain, resonance, and damping.
3.  Use Laplace transforms to analyze and tune the performance of a linear system with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) negative feedback.
4.  Use Laplace transforms to analyze and design 1st through 4th order active filters.
5.  Evaluate the performance of circuits using standard laboratory measurements and simulations.
