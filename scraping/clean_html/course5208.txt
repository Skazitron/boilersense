ECE 49022 - Electrical Engineering Senior Design Projects

Credit Hours: 4.00.  Lecture sessions provide the student with background information on the design and management of projects. Formal lectures cover, for example, design for manufacturability, design for quality, test and evaluation, reliability and ethics, patents and copyrights, plus case studies. During the laboratory sessions, the students work in teams on challenging open-ended electrical engineering project that draws on previous coursework. Projects routinely involve standard design facets (such as consideration of alternative solutions, feasibility considerations, and detailed system descriptions) and include a number of realistic constraints (such as cost, safety, reliability, and aesthetics). Lectures require use of the I-Clicker system.
