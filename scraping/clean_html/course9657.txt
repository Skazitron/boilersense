Learning Outcomes: 
1.  The students will gain knowledge, overview, and understanding in several fundamental mathematical discipline which fall into four basic categories: voting and apportionment; growth; management of networks; data analysis.
2.  Students will assimilate these mathematical ideas while applying them to practical everyday questions, and in turn gain an understanding how real life programs give rise to development of mathematical theories.
