SFS 31100 - Aquaponics

Credit Hours: 1.00.  (FNR 31300) (HORT 31110) There has been a significant renewed interest in the investigation of integrated fish-food plant systems. Such systems have a long and rich history, particularly in Asia; and our impending food crisis has kindled an interest in developing aquaponics systems in western countries. Many growers are turning to controlled environment and hydroponic production methods to produce high-value crops in tight quarters. The waste disposal problem of the fish can become the nutrient supply to the plants. Typically offered Fall.
