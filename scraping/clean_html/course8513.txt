CGT 37700 - Scientific Visualization

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is an introduction to the use of computer graphics to help user gain insight into scientific datasets. Applications from atmospheric science, medicine and physics will be explored. Topics will include the fundamental approaches to scalar-valued data (volume rendering, iso-surface extraction), vector-valued data (glyphs, streamlines), and tenors-valued data (ellipsoidal, quadric and super quadric glyphs). Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
