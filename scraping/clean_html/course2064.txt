ME 30801 - Fluid Mechanics Laboratory

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course is the lab component of an already established ME 30900 Fluid Mechanics (4 cr) course, which is now being split into an ME 30800 (3 cr) Fluid Mechanics lecture course, and the material covered in this new ME 30801 (1 cr) Fluid Mechanical Laboratory. The content of both of these courses remains unchanged. The splitting of the lab from the lecture will enable better enrollment load balancing in the existing ME undergraduate laboratory facilities. Details of this new laboratory are outlined in the appended material below. Typically offered Fall Spring.
