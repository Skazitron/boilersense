CHM 26800 - Organic Chemistry Laboratory Honors

Credit Hours: 2.00.  A continuation of CHM 26700. Experiments, more sophisticated than those in CHM 26600, are designed to illustrate and extend the concepts presented in CHM 26200. A major portion of the course is devoted to organic qualitative analysis. The student is expected to identify unknown compounds by classical methods as well as by the use of modern instrumentation like infrared gas chromatography and nuclear magnetic resonance.
