EAPS 58300 - Geology Of Landfills

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course consists of the application of the geological sciences to the siting, exploration and site evaluation for solid waste disposal landfills, plus the evaluation of existing landfill facilities as they pertain to soils, bedrock, stratigraphy, landforms, geologic processes, and hydrogeology. Included are soil and rock exploration, laboratory testing, installation of ground water monitoring devices, and evaluation of contaminant transport. Both attenuation and confinement landfill systems are considered. Geological aspects of solid waste disposal regulations are reviewed and compared to those for hazardous waste disposal. Classroom discussions include evaluation of specific landfill examples and a semester project on a landfill evaluation. A one-day field investigation is required.
