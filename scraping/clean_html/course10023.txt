HSCI 36000 - Everyday Toxicology: Poisonings From Clinics To Courtrooms

Credit Hours: 2.00.  Exposure to chemicals happens every day in human life through the living environment and diet; yet the health impact and toxicological consequences of these exposures are often unknown to general populations. This 300-level course examines basic concepts of toxicology in human health as they apply to the exposure of environmental agents, e.g., chemicals, metals, and poisons in daily life and attempted poisoning in criminal cases and political assassins. With an emphasis on historical accounts of poisonings and case analyses, the course describes commonly encountered chemicals and poisons, their symptoms, clinical diagnosis, basic toxicological mechanisms, and medical interventions. Students will also learn some of the large scale environmental and occupational incidents that have led to legal actions, and the role of toxicology in forensic investigation of purposed poisoning. The course is ideal to students who are inspired to become a future healthcare professional in any of the health-oriented pre-professional programs or students with majors in biomedical health sciences, environmental and occupational health sciences, medical laboratory science, and/or public health.
