ENGL 34300 - Labor And Literature

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course introduces its students to the transformative synergy between the labor of literature and labor within literature. In contrast to accepting the marketplace as a societal monolith, the readings illustrate the role of labor in creation. This course will examine labor taken in its broadest sense, from the labor of self-fashioning to the labor of industries; the labor of life and the labor of destruction and the implications of the laboring body from market creation to market collapse. Diverse readings range from traditional literary staples to modern representations of the labor market. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
