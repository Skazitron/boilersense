BTNY 26200 - Plant Structure And Tissue Biology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on fundamental knowledge of the internal structure of plants, including distinct cell types, tissues, tissue systems, and organs that make up a plant. Lectures and laboratories will cover the structural parts that comprise the plant body including three major vegetative organs (roots, stems, and leaves) and a set of reproductive organs (flowers, fruits, and seeds). The goal of this course is to understand the internal organization of plants, to learn multiple lab techniques critical for plant science research, and to develop critical thinking and problem solving skills.
