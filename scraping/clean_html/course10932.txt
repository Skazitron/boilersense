Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Learn the definition of some key particle properties and appreciate the critical importance of particle characterization in the design of particulate processes.
2.  Gain an understanding of the population balance as a way of analyzing particulate processes and be able to apply it to a new, unseen problem. 
3.  Gain an understanding of important science underlying many particulate processes including powder, wetting and particle mechanics.
4.  Use a combination of this science base, prior chemical engineering knowledge and the population balance to solve design and operating problems in crystallization, granulation, grinding, spray drying and aerosol processes.
5.  Become familiar with some of the typical engineering equipment used for each process studied.
