BME 20100 - Biomolecules: Structure, Function, And Engineering Applications

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Classes of molecules (biomolecules) such as sugars, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids that form the cellular components of living organisms. Explores the chemistry behind the structure and function of these important classes of biological molecules. Hydrogen-bonding, hydrophobic forces, electrostatic interactions along with other weak interactions discussed with reference to their importance in biomolecular systems in an engineering context.
