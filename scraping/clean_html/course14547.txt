AMST 31000 - Invention, Innovation, And Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course focuses on the various ways that invention, innovation, and design shape the modern world. We will investigate the forms, uses, and meanings of a diverse set of objects, networks, and systems that influence the ways we live. We will explore these ideas through the concepts of consumption, waste, and "smart" to gain a deeper understanding of how material infrastructures influence human existence. This project-based course will use readings, discussions, and critical reflections to inform a series of hands-on projects to understand our roles as designers, creators, and users of science, technology, and material culture. Permission of instructor required.
