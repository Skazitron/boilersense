EAPS 31500 - Biogeochemistry

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course examines the main element cycles of Earth: carbon, oxygen/hydrogen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorous, and trace metals, and how they are interconnected from terrestrial, aquatic/ocean, and atmospheric perspectives. General chemistry concepts such as equilibrium, free energy, electrochemistry are used to understand the energetics of the cycles. Connection between the cycles and environmental problems, such as climate change and air pollution will be emphasized.
