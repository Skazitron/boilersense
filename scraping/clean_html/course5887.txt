PHYS 67200 - Advanced Physics Laboratory

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Provides modern laboratory experience for graduate students in physics. Emphasis is on student initiative in accomplishing difficult but meaningful results. The course is intended to fill the gap between undergraduate-level laboratory, with detailed description of each experiment, and real-life experimental work. Students will share in the responsibility of determining how to conduct many of these experiments, learn how to use original equipment manuals, redesign experiments, and redefine goals depending on the progress.  Prerequisite:  graduate level E & M and QM courses, undergraduate level laboratory course.  Permission of instructor required.  Typically offered Fall Spring.
