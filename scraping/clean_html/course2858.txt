CS 24200 - Introduction To Data Science

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (STAT 24200) This course provides a broad introduction to the field of data science. The course focuses on using computational methods and statistical techniques to analyze massive amounts of data and to extract knowledge. It provides an overview of foundational computational and statistical tools for data acquisition and cleaning, data management and big data systems. The course surveys the complete data science process from data to knowledge and gives students hands-on experience with tools and methods. Basic knowledge of Python required. Computer Science majors cannot count this course as a degree requirement but can take it for credit as a free elective if taken before CS 37300, 34800, 47100, 47300, 44800.
