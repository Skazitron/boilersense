MGMT 46501 - Strategic Sourcing And Procurement

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This elective course will serve as an important complement to the existing  OM modules (e.g., MGMT 36100 Operations Management) to introduce more in-depth knowledge about supply chain management to undergraduate students, especially those major in SC&OM, focusing on strategic sourcing and procurement operations which are the building blocks for supply chain operations. More specifically, this course will introduce procure-to-pay process, category management, supplier selection and evaluation, supplier relationship management, vertical integration, global sourcing, outsourcing, auctioning, supply contract design and negotiation,  business ethics, legal and compliance issues, etc..  Sourcing and procurement is the major job title for supply chain operations jobs in the industry and our course can also help students to get the professional certificate of sourcing and procurement. Hence, it may also help senior students prepare for the job placements. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
