BMS 52400 - Introduction To Confocal Microscopy And Image Analysis

Credit Hours: 1.00.  Introduction to the principles of confocal microscopy and rudiments of image analysis. Confocal microscopy can be used in biological and nonbiological systems and is, therefore, an interdisciplinary tool in the modern research laboratory. The three-dimensional reconstruction of images allows discovery of complex structures. Deals with fluorescence excitation and emission, optical design, basic image analysis principles, and application areas for which the technology has been targeted. The student will have a good understanding of the application and use of the technology by the end of the course.
