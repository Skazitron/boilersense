STAT 51600 - Basic Probability And Applications

Credit Hours: 3.00.  A first course in probability, intended to serve as a background for statistics and other applications. Sample spaces and axioms of probability, discrete and continuous random variables, conditional probability and Bayes' theorem, joint and conditional probability distributions, expectations, moments and moment generating functions, law of large numbers, and central limit theorem.
