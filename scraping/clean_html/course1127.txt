AAE 51200 - Computational Aerodynamics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Finite difference methods for solving fluid flow problems. Review of classification of partial differential equations, well-posed problems, and discrete approximation of partial differential equations. Matrix and von Neumann stability analysis. Consistency and convergence. Grid generation: elliptic, hyperbolic, and transfinite mesh generation methods. Methods for solving the unsteady Euler equations: finite-volume formulations, flux-split and flux-difference formulations, shock-capturing, formulation of boundary conditions, artificial viscosity models, and multi-grid acceleration.
