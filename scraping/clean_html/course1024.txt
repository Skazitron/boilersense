EAPS 58000 - Geodynamics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will provide students with a first order understanding of geophysical processes by developing analytical solutions to a variety of geophysical and planetary thermo-mechanical problems. Topics will include stress and strain, rheology, elasticity and flexure, faulting, and conductive heat transfer, and fluid mechanics.  We will develop governing analytical equations based on first order principles, such as the conservation of mass, energy, and momentum, and solve these equations for a number of boundary conditions.
