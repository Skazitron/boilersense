ECET 22400 - Electronic Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is a survey of key electrical and electronics systems, their basic performance and applications. DC fundamentals include sources, resistance, Ohm's and Kirchhoff's Laws with simple circuits. AC systems include transformers and reactive elements, power production and distribution, filtering, motors and relays. Computer systems are presented with a microprocessor and provide the ability to write and read both digital and analog data. Analog systems include diodes, transistors, IC amplifiers, and analog-digital and digital to analog conversions. The semester closes by combining all of the topics presented in the control of motor speed.
