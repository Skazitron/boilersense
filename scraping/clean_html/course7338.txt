MSE 55600 - Fracture Of Materials

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The failure and fracture of materials under applied stress are the focal points of this course, with particular emphasis on the material characteristics that influence fracture. The initial subjects covered in this course will include introductions to linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) and elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM). Subsequently, the strength and toughness of metals, ceramics, and polymers will be explored with regard to processing property relationships and microstructure. Special topics will include fracture mechanism maps, Weibull statistics, toughening mechanisms, and failure analysis. This course is distinct from a course on fracture mechanics in that the fundamental materials aspects of fracture are of paramount importance.  Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Spring.
