PSY 60901 - Multilevel Modeling

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course familiarizes students with (1) generalized linear mixed (multilevel) models that are often used in the social sciences, and (2) best practices in the models' applications and interpretations. These models are extensions of classic linear regression models, and they go by many names: multilevel modes, hierarchical models, mixed models, etc. Throughout the course, models and methods will be introduced conceptually and will be illustrated using real and simulated data. Prerequisites: graduate coursework in regression and ANOVA, or by permission. Permission of department required.
