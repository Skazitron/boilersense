BIOL 43200 - Reproductive Physiology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an integrated approach to examining how tissues interact to regulate reproductive processes. Each section begins by describing fundamental commonalities of a reproductive event in a variety of species. This is followed by an emphasis on the difference in the details of that event among species. Students will be strongly encouraged to initiate and participate in discussions related to course topics during class. To gain a deeper understanding of physiological processes, students are asked to select a current research article related to reproductive physiology. Students are then required to present an analysis of article to the class in a formal presentation. Some of the topics to be covered in lecture include ovarian and testicular function, the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, fertilization, establishment of the placenta, maternal support of pregnancy, parturition, and lactation.
