MET 44301 - Joining Processes

Credit Hours: 3.00. Topics cover joining technologies such as fastening, welding, brazing/soldering, adhesive, and diffusion bonding processes of metals, ceramics, plastics, and composites. The materials, processes, destructive and non-destructive evaluation, and design aspects of these technologies as well as current production practices will be presented. Emphasis will be placed on identification and optimization of key processing parameters. Students will be exposed to commonly used technologies, equipment, and methods for joint design, formation, testing, and optimization to better understand key parameters and process variables, and their influence on optimum joint designs. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
