ENGL 11100 - American Language And Culture For International Students II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Students will continue to develop the foundational language skills and knowledge that they need to succeed in their other classes at Purdue and to prepare for further academic and professional opportunities. Students will also deepen their understanding of American culture and improve their ability to think about cultural differences in positive ways. In a sense, this class will be a bridge to help you transition to other language-intensive courses at Purdue where you need to read, write, and speak frequently and/or work in groups (such as business, engineering, literature, public speaking, and social sciences). Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
