BCHM 43400 - Medical Topics In Biochemistry

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course applies the principles of biochemistry and metabolic regulation to understand the diagnosis and treatment of human disease. The course emphasizes the biochemistry relevant to diabetes, blood disorders and the medical consequences of liver disease and aging. Roughly half of the class time is focused on small group activities including team-based learning and problem-based learning using patient cases. Students will search authoritative sources to discover links between biochemistry and clinical symptoms and communicate that information to their peers.
