Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Understand and use decrement models in conjunction with interest rate models to evaluate insurance, annuities, and investments. 
2.  Apply models to calculate actuarial values, gross and net premiums, and benefit and expense reserves. Among the decrement models learned will be standard mortality, models, static mortality table models, and continuous time Markov chains in both a single decrement and multiple decrement environment.
