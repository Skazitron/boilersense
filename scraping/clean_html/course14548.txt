AMST 32000 - Understanding The National Football League

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course counters the cultural myth that sports are "simply a form of entertainment" or an "escape from reality" and takes seriously the notion that sports matter as a social, cultural, and political force. Students will use academically informed inquiry and investigation to examine broader cultural dynamics through a critical examination of the National Football League. Course topics include how the NFL shapes social identities including race, gender, sexuality, and American identity, the connection between football and militarism, the relationship between the NFL and commercialism, the role the NFL plays in the triad of men's violence, among other topics.
