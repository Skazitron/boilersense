POL 33500 - China And The Challenges Of Globalization

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Globalization is a very popular topic, resulting in a lot of loose and poorly thought-through talk and writing around the subject. The view taken in this course is that to understand current processes of globalization we need to examine it in less broad and amorphous ways by focusing on its specific manifestations. Thus, this course focuses on how China has managed the challenges of globalization. China is a particularly useful case study because it failed the challenges of globalization in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. For an ancient civilization such as China, this failure had tremendous impact on its national pride. The Chinese refer to this historical juncture as the "century of shame." Towards the end of the 20th century and the onset of the 21st, China faced again the challenges of globalization and has arisen to the tasks in a spectacular fashion, transforming a largely rural and agriculture economy into the world's second largest economic power. This amazing transformation is leading some to proclaim that the 21st century will belong to China! Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
