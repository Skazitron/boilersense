ENGL 21900 - Figures Of Myth And Legend III: Magic And Marvels

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course surveys stories of elves, fairies, wizards, witches, etc., and explores the allure of all things marvelous, strange, and magical. It considers how language itself constitutes a kind of magic; examines magic as technology and vice versa, since, as Arthur C. Clarke famously declared: "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic"; and seeks to understand how people across history have used stories of magic to reinforce (mystify) or upend (defamiliarize) the status quo. Typically offered Fall Spring.
