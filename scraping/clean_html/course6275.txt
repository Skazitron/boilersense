VCS 87700 - Large Animal Lameness

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Students are exposed to, and responsible for, case-oriented problem-solving experiences with large animal lamenesses and orthopedic diseases. The case exposure is primarily equine, but lameness students are expected to help with food animal lamenesses and orthopedics, as a comparative biomedical approach to studying locomotion and the musculoskeletal system. Depending upon the availability of lameness cases, lameness students will participate with the general clinic responsibilities and emergency duty in the large animal surgery. Students may be allowed to spend up to three days off campus to work with a veterinarian engaged in practice in the student's area of interest. This off-campus experience should enhance the student's education by complementing experience gained on campus.   Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
