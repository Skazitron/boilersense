CS 50024 - Data Engineering II

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course introduces students to the fundamentals of database management systems (DBMS) from a user's perspective. The principles of modeling an enterprise using Entity-Relationship diagrams and transforming the model into a relational or NoSQL database are illustrated through a range of examples.  The SQL language is used to create, query, aggregate, and update a relational database. NOSQL databases and the related data models (column, graph, and document-based) are introduced. Experience in Python Programming is required.
