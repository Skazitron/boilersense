HK 44400 - Balance Rehab In Older Adults

Credit Hours: 3.00.  In this course, students learn about the decline in motor function that occurs in older adults and techniques to improve motor function in an older population. Topics include decreased balance control, loss of muscle strength, and declines in adaptive locomotion as a function of age. Students enrolled in this class also participate in an off-campus lab. In the lab, students are paired with an older adult and use the knowledge gained in lecture to improve the motor function of the older adult. This class provides students with a unique opportunity to gain hands-on experience working with an older population. Permission of instructor required.
