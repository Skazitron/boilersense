MSE 36700 - Materials Processing Laboratory

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This laboratory is intended as an intensive experience in processing techniques used for ceramics, metals, and polymers. Sintering of a ceramic, casting and post-processing (work hardening, heat treatment, etc.) of a metal, and preparation and extrusion of a polymer are the suggested processes. The measurements (e.g., powder size, compaction force, temperature, grain size, molecular weight) applicable to the successful processing of the material and the final properties (e.g., hardness, ductility, strength, stiffness) will be emphasized. Typically offered Spring.
