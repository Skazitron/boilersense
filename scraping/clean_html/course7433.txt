BIOL 11500 - Biology Resource Seminar

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This course is designed to help integrate new biology students into the Department of Biological Sciences, to help them adjust to university life, and to assist them in developing academic and intellectual survival skills using the medium of introductory Biology courses. The course meets twice a week in groups of 20-25 students. Each section is led by an academic advisor and an undergraduate teaching intern. The class periods have an on-going emphasis on connecting students to one another as resources while learning information, critical thinking skills and problem-solving strategies. Topics include bioethics, time management, available academic resources, biology majors and curricula and career development. Students are exposed to opportunities in undergraduate research, summer internships, the study abroad program, and teaching internships. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to plan their college education rather than merely choose their courses. Permission of department required.
