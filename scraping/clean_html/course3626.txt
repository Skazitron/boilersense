COM 65100 - Organizational Culture And Internal Communication

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The modern workplace had transformed well before a global pandemic magnified the paradigm shift already under way. In the United States, both consumers and the first five-generation workforce began to demand more from brand statements and value propositions. Those demands include genuine commitment to inclusion and diversity internally and corporate social responsibility externally. This course highlights the vital role professional communicators have in conveying brand and value statements that emanate from the organization's cultural core and carry forward to the consumer universe.
