HONR 59901 - Research Mentorship Development Program

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The Research Mentorship Development Program is designed for Purdue based on a nationally recognized curriculum and prepares graduate students or postdocs to mentor undergraduates in research. Effective mentoring of undergraduate researchers requires specific skillsets and approaches. Implementation of these strategies can lead to a productive and mutually beneficial experience for both students and their mentors. The course is designed for graduate students who plan to work with new researchers in their labs or research groups and who plan to enter academia or pursue careers in which they will mentor others in scholarship or research. Graduate students or postdocs selected for the program are matched with honors students who are interested in research. Permission of department required.
