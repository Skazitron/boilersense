BME 55500 - Magnetic Resonance Imaging Theory

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course covers fundamental aspects of magnetic resonance imaging systems with an emphasis on theory, methodology, and instrumentation. Key principles are derived from the Bloch equations and Maxwell's equations. Topics include pulse sequences, signal acquisition, spatial encoding in k-space, image reconstruction, and tissue contrast. Major components of the MRI scanner are examined, including the static magnet, gradient and shim coils, transmit and receive chains, and radiofrequency coils and arrays. Learning outcomes are assessed by solving problem sets integrating theory with practical applications. As a final research project, students survey recent literature to identify a specialized topic of interest and deliver a peer-evaluated presentation to the class.
