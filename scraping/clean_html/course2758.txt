TLI 66200 - Philosophy Of Technology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The term technology has multiple meaning and applications so vast that one clear and all-encompassing definition of the term has become unattainable.  However, to build an epistemology of technology, we must explore ways to define technology so to provide a foundation for a philosophy of technology. This course will explore multiple views and definitions of technology embedded within the scholarly work focused on technology in order to build and defend a philosophy of technology. Typically offered Fall.
