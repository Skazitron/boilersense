SLHS 66100 - Advanced Medical Audiology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The clinical practice of audiology encompasses the audiological assessment and habilitation/rehabilitation of hearing loss arising from a wide variety of medical and environmental etiologies. It is essential that audiologists have a firm understanding of the most common causes and medical treatments of hearing impairment for all age groups. Additionally, the future clinician will be better served by recognizing how rapidly information changes in this arena and becoming comfortable with reliable educational resources that are available for life-long learning in this area. Audiologists also practice in a medical setting and thus must be comfortable with the medical approaches and terminology used by otolaryngologists, otologists, neuro-otologists, pediatricians, radiologists, anesthesiologists and other physicians. Additionally, audiologists may be the first contact with a hearing-impaired patient and their role in the referral process will be emphasized. Typically offered Spring.
