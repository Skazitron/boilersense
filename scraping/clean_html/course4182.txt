ABE 42500 - Water Quality Engineering

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides in-depth perspectives on water quality in source and environmental water system (lakes, rivers, groundwaters, and coastal waters) including sources and causes of water quality impairments and design of workable and cost-effective management solutions. The course integrates hydrology, chemistry, biology, and ecology as foundations of water quality management and incorporates operation mechanisms of management practices in designing solutions for pollution control. Students will have opportunities to engage with lectures, water quality measurements and data analysis, computer modeling, case studies, design and discussion sessions.
