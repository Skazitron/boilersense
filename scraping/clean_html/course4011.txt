BME 48900 - Senior Design Project Lab

Credit Hours: 2.00. The biomedical engineering design process is completed starting from a preliminary system design. Student will work with their teammates to implement (e.g. build, test, iterate and evaluate) a solution to address a biomedical engineering problem statement and meet the technical specifications set forth. The resulting project design is presented and evaluated through an oral presentation, laboratory demonstration, and a final written document.

    2.000 Credit hours
