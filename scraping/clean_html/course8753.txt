ECON 35200 - Intermediate Macroeconomics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course offers a rigorous introduction to macroeconomic theory and empirics with real-world applications. We examine longstanding stylized facts about long-run economic growth, short-run economic fluctuations (booms and recessions), and the aggregate effects of government policy. We study determinants of equilibrium in labor, consumption, investment, and money markets as well as the role of fiscal and monetary policies in closed and open economies.
