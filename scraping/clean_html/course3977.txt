BME 31400 - Experimental Methods In Biomechanics

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course focuses on the concepts and applications of mechanics, imaging, and instrumentation methods towards evaluating experimental biomechanics at multiple length scales. Core concepts include mechanics of materials, dynamics, contact theory, and the simplifying assumptions and standardizations often needed to conduct experiments on biomaterials and living systems. Experimental methods may include atomic force microscopy, digital image correlation, and motion analysis.
