BTNY 55800 - Pathogens Of Plants

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Plant pathology is the science of plant diseases and of the microorganisms that cause them and of our attempts to manage plant diseases. The ultimate goal of plant pathologists is to reduce the losses caused by diseases, thereby, increasing both the quality and quantity of the world food supply. Plant diseases are caused by the same types of microorganisms that cause disease in animals and humans and, as such, many of the principles that apply to human and animal medicine apply to plant diseases. It is the objective of this course to introduce students to the major types of plant pathogens (plant pathogenic bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and fungi), their basic biology and examples of the types of diseases they cause. It will be expected that students have knowledge in plant pathology.
