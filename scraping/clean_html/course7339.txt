MSE 55900 - Phase Equilibria In Multicomponent Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  A detailed examination of the thermodynamics of phase equilibria in multicomponent systems, experimental methods of determining these equilibria by measurements of thermodynamic activity and graphical method of representing the equilibria. This is followed by an examination of theoretical models of the behavior of solutions and an examination of the extent to which observed phenomena can be understood and predicted in terms of the models.   Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Fall.
