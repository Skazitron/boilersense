FNR 30500 - Conservation Genetics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Fundamentals and principles of genetics, including Mendelian inheritance, genetic mapping & linkage, DNA fingerprinting, phylogeography, and speciation.  Topics cover the theoretical and empirical evidence illustrating how mutation, migration, drift, and natural selection influence the evolution of genes in natural populations.  Designed for ecologists and natural resource professionals. Typically offered Spring.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Develop conceptual understanding of modern genetics and the use of molecular markers in studies of wildlife/fisheries/forest management, ecology, and evolutionary biology.
2.  Explore how genetic information is used in sportfish stockings, wildlife reintroductions, and selective harvest of native trees.
3.  Recognize and predict the genetic ramifications of these artificial activities.
4.  Compare these effects to the consequences of natural disturbances. (e.g., glaciations).
