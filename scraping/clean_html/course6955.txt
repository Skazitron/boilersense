BCHM 10100 - Introduction To Biochemistry Laboratory

Credit Hours: 1.00.  An entry-level laboratory course to help freshmen students become interested and excited about scientific research, and at the same time, gain the skills necessary to become better prepared for undergraduate research opportunities. Students perform real-world experiments to identify single base-pair changes in a DNA sequence that can change a protein-protein interaction. Students learn common laboratory skills such as pipetting, centrifugation, and sterile technique. Students also learn how to display and interpret scientific results in written form.
