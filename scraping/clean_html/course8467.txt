CGT 27500 - Data Visualization II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides a practical introduction to exploratory data analysis and data mining to better inform data visualization applications. The course introduces a practical approach for making sense out of data. Students are introduced to issues inherent to the data analysis process or data mining projects. The course covers: (1) how to prepare data prior to analysis, (2) how to generate summaries of the data, (3) how to identify non-trivial facts, patterns and relationships in the data and (4) how to create models from the data to better understand the data and make predictions. After data is analyzed students will use the data visualization process and techniques to visually represent the data. The course will also introduce the use of high-level programming languages for data analysis and data visualization.
