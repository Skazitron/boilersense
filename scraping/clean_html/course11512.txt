PSY 40100 - Language And The Brain

Credit Hours: 3.00.  (SLHS 40100) This course is an overview of the neutral systems that underlie the core components of language, including speech perception and production, reading and writing, morphology, syntax, semantics, and discourse. During the past few decades, there has been an unprecedented increase in studies on these topics, due in large part to the widespread use of highly sensitive brain mapping techniques that enable researchers to identify relationships between particular brain areas and particular language functions. The findings that have been emerged from this recent explosion of research are exciting and important for several reasons. They provide fresh insights into the nature of the uniquely human capacity for language, and they have significant implications for understanding and treating language disorders that result from brain injury. Typically offered Fall.
