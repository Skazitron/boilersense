EAPS 20000 - Water World: Processes And Challenges In Global Hydrology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to the Hydrological Sciences designed for undergraduate students. Course uses an Earth-systems approach to emphasize the interconnections and feedback between the hydrosphere, geosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere. Course topics will include: global water-balance, techniques for measuring components of the water-balance, hydrological uncertainties, groundwater, surface-water, vadose zone, forest and watershed hydrology, global change hydrology, human and climate impacts on water resource, and water on the worlds.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Create, analyze, and evaluate water-balances.
2.  Define and recognize the importance of the groundwater, surface-water, and vadose zone water systems, and explain interactions and interconnections between these three systems.
3.  Evaluate human and climate impacts on water resources and explain how hydrological processes impact biodiversity and ecological functioning.
4.  Create conceptual models for how these systems may change with growing human populations, land development and deforestation, and climate change.
