BME 36000 - Introduction To Biomedical Imaging

Credit Hours: 3.00. The main focus of this course is on basic principles and modes of major bioimaging modalities.  This course covers image characterization, interactions of electromagnetic radiation with tissue, fundamental principles in imaging and detection, and modes of imaging modalities (e.g. reflection, transmission, absorption, and emission).  Conventional bioimaging modalities will be used to teach the topics.  This course is particularly aimed at students in science and engineering interested in gaining a conceptual understanding of several critical biological and biomedical imaging methods, including optical microscopy, ultrasound, X-ray imaging, computed tomography, nuclear medicine, magnetic resonance imaging, and mobile health. Overall, this course provides a conceptual framework for biomedical imaging in a reasonably concise and understandable format (with minimal mathematical approaches).
