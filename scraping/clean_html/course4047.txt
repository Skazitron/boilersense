BME 64600 - Deep Learning - Theory And Practice Of Deep Neural Networks

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course teaches the theory and practice of deep neural networks from basic principles through state-of-the-art methods. The class blends hands-on programming, using a variety of state-of-the-art programming frameworks, with theoretical treatment based on current literature. Implementation will emphasize the use of the Pytorch language and the use of dynamic computational graphs. Some previous experience with optimization techniques is important for success in the course.
