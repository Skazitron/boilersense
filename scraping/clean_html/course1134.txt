AAE 52300 - Introduction To Remote Sensing

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Fundamentals of satellite and airborne remote sensing. Basic physical principles of electromagnetic wave propagation will be introduced. From this foundation, the phenomenology's enabling properties of the atmosphere; ocean and land surface to be measured at a distance will be developed. These principles will be applied to the design of instruments and satellite missions for Earth observation. Microwave instruments will be emphasized, although there will also be discussion of optical systems. Most of the material would also be applicable to remote sensing of other planets. Intended for students in Engineering or the Sciences.
