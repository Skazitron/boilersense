IE 47200 - Imagine, Model, Make

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course develops a holistic view of an initial competency in engineering design by conceiving, designing, manufacturing, and optimizing a system component such as a complex structural part. Activities include hand sketching, CAD modeling, and operation of CNC machining equipment for rapid prototyping. Tolerance requirements will be verified and optimized prior to the fabrication of the part in the laboratory using rapid prototyping techniques. The focus is on the design process itself as well as the complementary roles of human creativity and computational methods and tools. Typically offered Fall.
