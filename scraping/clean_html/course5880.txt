PHYS 65900 - Theoretical Techniques Of Elementary Particle Physics II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Theory and phenomenology of the standard model of elementary particle interactions. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) theory of strong interactions: asymptotic freedom, perturbative QCD applied to high energy electron-positron annihilation and deep inelastic phenomena using operator product expansion, renormalization group, extended parton model, and Altarelli-Parisi equation. SU(3)xSU(3) current algebra and effective Lagrangians, chiral perturbation theory and chiral anomalies. Weak decay of heavy quarks: Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing matrix, CP violation. Neutrino physics. Electroweak symmetry breaking and Higgs physics. Other topics of current research interests in and beyond the standard model.  Prerequisite: PHYS 65800. Permission of instructor required. Typically offered Spring.
