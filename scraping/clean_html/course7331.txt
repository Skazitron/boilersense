MSE 53000 - Materials Processing In Manufacturing

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Examination of the production/synthesis of engineering materials and the subsequent processing steps required to obtain a desired shape and microstructure. The course covers four major categories of materials processing: primary processing or materials synthesis, solidification processing, deformation processing, and powder processing, and provides specific examples from the processing of polymers, metals, and ceramics. The goal is to connect fundamental principles of materials processing to manufacturing processes. Credit will not be given for both MSE 5300 and 36700. Typically offered Fall.
