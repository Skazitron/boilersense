Credit Hours: 3.00.  The MPH degree plans of study require a culminating project to be completed in the final semester of study.

The final product is in the form of a grant proposal. Guidance for proposal development is achieved through completion of a grant-writing workshop and feedback from a faculty advisor. Permission of department required.
