MA 13800 - Mathematics For Elementary Teachers II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Elementary school teachers must understand how multiplication gives rise to exponents and how to represent, interpret, and compute exponents from problem situations. They must also understand how to represent practical situations using algebraic and fractional expressions, and verbally interpret graphs of functions. They have to know basic concepts of probability theory. This course covers conceptual and practical notions of exponents and radicals; algebraic and rational functions, algebraic equations and inequalities, systems of linear equations, polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Notions of probability.  Typically offered Fall Spring.
