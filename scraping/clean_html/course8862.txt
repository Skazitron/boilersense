ECON 66200 - Game Theory

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  In this course, we will examine some of the basic elements of Game Theory. Game Theory studies strategic environments in which each individual's payoff depends upon both their own actions as well as the actions of others. Game Theory attempts to develop an understanding of such situations and to provide a formal framework and solution concepts for making better strategic choices.
