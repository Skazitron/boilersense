Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Recognize the signs and symptoms of plant disease so that you can distinguish between diseases caused by
pathogenic entities and those caused by environmental factors. This is important for the formulation of methods
to manage the disease.
2.  Compare and contrast the survival and spread of the major plant pathogen groups: fungal and fungal-like
pathogens, bacteria, viruses, nematodes, and parasitic plants so that appropriate control methods can be used
to mitigate diseases caused by these pathogens. Control measures are based on the biology of the pathogen
3.  Explain how pathogens, hosts, and environments interact in plant disease epidemics to predict the severity of a
disease at a given time. Such information is important in deciding whether to use management strategies.
