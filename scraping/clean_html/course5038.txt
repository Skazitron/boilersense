ECE 20008 - Electrical Engineering Fundamentals II Lab

Credit Hours: 1.00.  This is a course in electronic measurement, circuit modeling, simulation and design techniques. These skills are developed through a variety of laboratory experiments including discrete semiconductor measurement, transistor amplifiers, motor control, and operational amplifier internals. The experiments develop practical skills through small design and soldering tasks. Finally, the course culminates in a two week group design project. In many ways this course is the laboratory of the co-requisite lecture course ECE 20002 Electrical Engineering Fundamentals II; however, we remind students that this is a standalone course that expects students will learn and demonstrate material not taught in other courses.
