IE 54100 - Nature-Inspired Computation

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is about algorithms that are inspired by naturally occurring phenomena and applying them to optimization, design and learning problems. The focus is on the process of abstracting algorithms from the observed phenomenon, their outcome analysis and comparison as well as their "science". This will be done primarily through the lens of evolutionary computation, swarm intelligence (ant colony and particle-based methods) and neural networks. Typically offered Fall Spring.
