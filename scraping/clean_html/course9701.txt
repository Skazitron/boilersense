MA 45401 - Galois Theory Honors

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will give a thorough introduction to Galois theory. Galois theory is a fundamental tool in many areas of mathematics, including number theory and algebraic geometry. This course will increase students' mathematical maturity and prepare them for graduate school. Topics include finite extension fields and their symmetries, ruler and compass constructions, complex roots of unity, solvable groups, and the solvability of polynomial equations by arithmetic and radical operations. This course is intended for third- or fourth-year students who have taken MA 45000 (Algebra Honors) or MA 45300 (Elements of Algebra I). Typically offered Spring.
