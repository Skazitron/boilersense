Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Apply the First Law of Thermodynamics and conversation of mass to analyze when testing fixed mass (closed) and steady flow control volume (open) systems and devices. 
2.  Understand the fundamental concepts of the Second Law of Thermodynamics and their application. Apply them to conversations between heat and work and to thermal efficiency.
3.  Test thermodynamic systems involving cycles such as Otto, Diesel, Rankine, and refrigeration cycles.
4.  Identify and operate laboratory equipment typically used in measurement and analysis of thermal systems.
5.  Use application software for analyzing, documenting, and presenting the results of technical work.
