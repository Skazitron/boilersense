BMS 81500 - Veterinary Neuroscience

Credit Hours: 2.00.  This course provides an introduction to neuroscience and its diagnostic application in veterinary medicine. Students will acquire terminology describing the anatomy and basic physiology that characterize neural systems. Integration of function/structure relationships will be introduced in lectures and laboratories, by reference to case studies, and by problem-solving.

Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Acquire of basic knowledge in neuroscience that will enable insightful diagnosis of diseases affecting the nervous system. 
2.  Know the parts of the nervous system described in each lecture/lab by their name, location, anatomic relationship to other parts and structures and their integrative function. Students will be able to describe how the nervous system of domestic mammals is organized and how these components contribute to nervous system function. 
3.  Acquire the ability to communicate this information effectively. 
4.  Know or logically theorize the physiological basis for any dysfunction that might arise due to specific pathological processes and anatomical lesions in the nervous system. The student will begin to develop an appreciation for the clinical signs and altered behavior that occurs following damage to or disorders of nervous system components. 
5.  Provide an introduction to the utility of the basic Neurological Exam in the diagnosis of nervous system disease.
