ECE 43300 - Power Electronics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to the fundamental operating principles of power conditioning circuits that are currently being used to effect power flow from AC to DC and vice versa. Emphasis is on the relationship between form and function of these circuits. Circuits discussed will include AC/DC line-commutated converters, DC/DC converters, DC/variable frequency converters, resonant converters, and AC/AC converters. Computer simulations will be used as a part of the coursework.
