NUCL 62000 - Advanced Topics In Radiation Damage

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Materials phenomena unique to nuclear reactor environments are examined quantitatively. The relation between these phenomena and the structure and properties of engineering materials is discussed. Coupled phenomena are considered in relation to materials modeling codes.  Prerequisite:  NUCL 42000 and NUCL 52000 (or other related/similar courses). Typically offered Spring.
