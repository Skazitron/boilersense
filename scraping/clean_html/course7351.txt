Learning Outcomes: 
1. Perform calculations to quantify material properties and microstructural characteristics. Example: Calculate the interplanar spacing of a family of atomic planes given a x-ray diffraction pattern.
2. Recognize the effect of composition and microstructure on material properties. Example: The effect of dislocation density on yield strength and electrical conductivity.
3. Take information from a known situation and apply it to a new situation. Example: Effect of temperature and applied stress on the peak positions in a XRD pattern.
4. Predict property response or microstructural changes based on imposed conditions. Example: Effects of temperature and alloying on the resistivity of metals.
5. Assess the interplay of two or more material properties. Example: Assess the effect of atomic bond strength on Young's modulus, coefficient of thermal expansion and melting temperature.
