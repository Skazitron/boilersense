AT 52500 - Process Improvement And Simulation

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course explores process modeling and simulation as applied to decision-making for process design and improvement. Emphasis is placed on understanding the application of process simulations to business problems including using fundamental statistical methods in the solution of an industry relevant problem. By planning and executing a computer-based simulation supporting an aviation or aerospace process design and improvement project, students improve analysis and project management skills. In addition to simulation, preparing visualizations of the process is also included for increased understanding of process interactions.
