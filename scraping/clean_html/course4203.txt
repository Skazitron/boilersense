ABE 52200 - Ecohydrology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Ecohydrology links hydrological and ecological processes at various spatiotemporal scales and is considered to be one of the most exciting frontiers of the future. Hydrological processes in individual ecosystems and the role of water in linking the myriad components of the landscape will be explored in this three-credit course. Interactions between hydrological and biological processes and factors that regulate and shape these interactions will be covered. The ecohydrology principles covered will include integration of water and biota at the catchment scale, nutrient transport and cycling, modeling ecohydrologic processes, and quantification of ecosystem services. Recommended: a prior course in hydrology.
