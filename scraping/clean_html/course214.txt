ENGL 34500 - Games And World Building

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Every game designer and gamer knows that there is more to narrative than just words on a page and more to worldbuilding than images on a screen. This course looks at the ways that narrative worlds get built in games. We will begin by looking at the narrative elements in analog games that have been the foundation of many digital games and move on to look at the elements in digital games that come together to form the worlds. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
