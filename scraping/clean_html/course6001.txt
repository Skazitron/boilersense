ENGR 46499 - Professional Practice Parallel Co-Op Semester IV

Credit Hours: 0.00.  Co-Op is an academic program with oversight by assigned Faculty Coordinators who serve as the instructor for participating students. Parallel Co-Op program participants are undergraduate students who work part-time (more than 12 hours per week and less than 30 hours per week) in paid computer science, engineering, polytechnic, or management positions during the academic year terms (fall and spring semesters) for an employer with a local operation or office. During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students work in full-time positions at any location offered by the employer. During the academic year, Parallel Co-Op students register for 6 to 9 credit hours of academic course load, and also for this zero-credit hour Parallel Co-Op course that carries half-time student status to recognize the academic impact of the experience. The combination of both academic course and Parallel Co-Op course registrations provides students with full-time status. During the summer term, Parallel Co-Op students register for a zero-credit hour Parallel Co-Op Summer course that carries full-time student status. Prerequisite: Student must be eligible to participate in the Cooperative Education (Co-Op) program, and have written documentation of valid work session with approved Co-Op employer.
