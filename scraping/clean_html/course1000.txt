EAPS 51800 - Soil Biogeochemistry

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course will provide an introduction to the physical and microbial processes governing the cycling of photosynthetically-produced organic matter on land and in streams and rivers. Organic geochemical transformations in the soil and litter will be highlighted along with methods of characterization of the organic constituents. Biogeochemical concepts of stabilization and destabilization of soil organic matter and stress response of terrestrial ecosystems will be reinforced through manipulation of actual data sets.
