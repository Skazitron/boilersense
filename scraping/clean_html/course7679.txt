BIOL 65001 - Techniques In Molecular Biology

Credit Hours: 1.00.  Techniques in Molecular Biology will introduce graduate students to the theory and practice of many commonly used methods. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the theoretical basis for these techniques, their utility in various circumstances, and their limitations. Although taught as a lecture, students should be able to take this knowledge back to the laboratory to help them in their research efforts. The course will be as close as possible to a laboratory experience without being in an actual laboratory setting. This course is designed to prepare students for other in-depth 60000-level scientific courses, for their rotations, and for future laboratory work. Exams will be experimental in nature (e.g., design and experiment to do something, or in this type of situation, which technique/vector/etc. would best be used, and why).
