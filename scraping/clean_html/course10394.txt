MET 31601 - Mechanics Of Machine Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Concepts of stress and strain analysis under combined loadings are introduced. Analyses emphasize use of von Mises stress, Mohr's circle, static failure theories, and fatigue failure criteria. Structural joints and buckling are also analyzed. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
