CS 53100 - Computational Geometry

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Computational geometry studies how to compute with and reason about geometric objects. The subject is playing an increasingly important role in computer graphics, game software, geometric modeling, geographic information systems, and many other applications. Course topics include convex hull, segment manipulations, triangulations, range searching, Voronoi diagrams, window queries, Delaunay triangulation, and duality. Some key algorithms are implemented. Questions of floating-point accuracy and robust algorithm design are considered throughout the course.
