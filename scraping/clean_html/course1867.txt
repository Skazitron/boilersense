ENGT 56100 - Metrology Concepts And Applications

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Metrology is a fundamental concept required for obtaining scientific data and understanding instrumentation. This course introduces the concepts of metrology associated with measurement systems: sensors, signal conditioning, data acquisition and analysis, as well as the error propagation.  System and environmental noise are investigated along with methods to mitigate influences of noise. Standards and calibration of instrumentation are also studied. Concepts of metrology for the seven basic units of measurements are described from the macro to nano-scale. Typically offered Fall.
