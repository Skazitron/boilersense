ME 50300 - Micro-And-Nano-Scale Energy Transfer Processes

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Transport of energy in natural and fabricated micro- and nano-scale structures. Physical nature of energy transport by three carriers-electrons, phonons, and photons. Bulk material properties (e.g., thermal/electrical conductivity) are derived from statistical particle transport theories. Effects of spatial confinement on bulk properties are quantified. Contemporary interdisciplinary engineering applications.
