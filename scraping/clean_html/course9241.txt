ECET 17700 - Data Acquisition And Systems Control

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Fundamental electrical parameters and measurement techniques are introduced. These are then applied to implementing power interfaces, actuators and sensors. Modules that provide signal conditioning, data conversion, filtering and controllers are evaluated. A full, closed loop control system is built and evaluated.
