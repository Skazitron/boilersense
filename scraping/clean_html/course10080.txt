HSCI 67100 - Biochemical Toxicology

Credit Hours: 2.00.   Toxicologists in all fields are concerned with mechanism of action or how a specific toxicant or class of toxicants produces toxicity.  Introductory toxicology courses typically focus on the adverse effects exerted by a specific compound, with some examination of mechanisms.  The entire focus of this upper level graduate course is on the "how" and the "why", or a detailed examination of biochemical mechanism of toxicity.  There will be some lectures, but the majority of the course will consist of student-led discussions on specific mechanisms of action.  Further, students will write a review-style article on a chosen mechanism of action.  Prerequisite: HSCI 56000.  Typically offered Spring.
