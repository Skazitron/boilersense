MET 53500 - Optimization Of Metalcasting Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course focuses on optimal design of metalcastings to fit structural requirements (applied loads) and to assure sound manufacturability (castability). Students are expected to learn the general principles of design optimization through hands-on laboratory exercises based on the application of finite element and computational fluid dynamics software. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
