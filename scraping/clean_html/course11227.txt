NUR 50500 - Sociocultural Influences On Health

Credit Hours: 2.00 or 3.00.  This course examines the influences of cultural and sub-cultural variables on health and health care delivery.  Students analyze and apply appropriate theoretical perspectives and current research to design evidence-based strategies that ground clinical decision making in advanced practice nursing.  Students use the National Standards on Culturally and Linguistically Appropriate Services (CLAS) as the basis for providing culturally competent care.  As students apply principles of culturally competent communication they are encouraged to develop insight and an attitude of resistance to stereotyping.  Students gain an understanding of the context of vulnerable and marginalized populations through the analysis of social, cultural, and economic influences that impact health and illness.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
