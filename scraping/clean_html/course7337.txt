MSE 55500 - Deformation Mechanisms In Crystalline Solids

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Focuses on the mechanisms for deformation and fracture of metal, intermetallic, and ceramic materials, with particular emphasis on high temperature properties. The industrial success of superalloys, dispersion-strengthened alloys, stainless steels, composites, and thermal barrier coatings will serve as the basis for exploring the relationship between composition, microstructure, and component application in high temperature performance. Topics included are alloying effects on dislocation climb and glide, grain boundary and lattice diffusion, and dynamic recrystallization. The interactions between environment and thermal and mechanical cycling also will be considered. Design tools for prediction and evaluation of component life will be investigated in detail, including an exploration of deformation mechanism maps. Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Fall.
