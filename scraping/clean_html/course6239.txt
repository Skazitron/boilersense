VCS 84400 - Client Communications - Companion Animal Practice

Credit Hours: 0.50. The course will be taught in a discussion format utilizing small group exercises and role-plays. The goal is to demonstrate and describe effective client communication skills. Because effective client communication is a learned skill, the course will provide multiple opportunities for students to practice and refine their skills. Students who participate in this course will be videotaped working through a scenario with a simulated client. While being videotaped and then watching oneself can be very uncomfortable and potentially embarrassing, it is a great way to improve communication skills and is worth the potential momentary discomfort. Typically offered Spring Summer.
