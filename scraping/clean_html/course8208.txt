HK 66900 - Exercise Metabolism And Biochemistry

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course is designed to provide students with practice using basic laboratory skills which can then be applied to more sophisticated techniques in biochemical analysis. The course is a laboratory-based class and will provide considerable "hands on" experience. Lectures will focus on laboratory procedures, calculations, common lab problems and solutions, and laboratory safety procedures. Most of these measures will be made using an exercise context, i.e., standard exercise physiology tests (VO2 max, Wingate tests, etc.) will be performed to allow us to acquire blood samples for analysis. Prerequisites: HK 56800 or permission of the instructor.  Typically offered Fall Spring.
