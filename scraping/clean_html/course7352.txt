MSE 64000 - Transmission Electron Microscopy And Crystal Imperfections

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Theory and application of TEM to problems in materials science and engineering. Principles of electron diffraction and microscopy are reviewed with the emphasis on the relationship between real and reciprocal space. Diffraction theory of imperfect crystals will be introduced. A primary part of the course will be a discussion of image contrasts in terms of atomistic structures of key crystal imperfections, including dislocations and grain boundaries. Experimental applications and image simulations will be included to amplify theoretical concepts. Offered in alternate years. Permission of instructor required. Typically offered Fall.
