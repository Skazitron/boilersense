BME 20400 - Biomechanics Of Hard And Soft Tissues

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Covers the mechanics of biological materials, with applications in the muscular-skeletal system, nerves, spinal cord, and vascular tissue, down to the level of the cell. Topics include center of mass, moment of inertia, basic understanding of stresses, strains, and deformations, axial elements, pressure vessels, beams, torsion, viscoelasticity, and thermal stress. Case studies and problem solving sessions used to emphasize the unique biological criteria which must be considered when mechanically analyzing both soft and hard tissues.
