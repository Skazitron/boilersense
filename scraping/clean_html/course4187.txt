ABE 45300 - Leadership In Biotechnology

Credit Hours: 1.00 to 3.00.  This course provides students that have completed the research experience in ABE 22600 and ABE 22700 an opportunity to continue their professional development by serving as peer leaders in the classroom. ABE 22600 and ABE 22700 are part of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's (HHMI) Science Education Alliance and provide an authentic laboratory research experience with the students engaged in hands-on discovery as a scientist with the ultimate objective of contributing new viral genomes to the scientific literature and public databases. As part of the model for implementing the course-based undergraduate research experience in ABE 22600 and ABE 22700, senior level students that successfully completed those courses serve as peer leaders in the classroom. Peer leaders attend the course section along with the currently enrolled students and build competencies in leadership by guiding their team on their research project throughout the semester. Permission of instructor required.
