ME 55900 - Micromechanics Of Materials

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Prediction of the macroscopie behavior of materials from their microstructure and the design of new materials.  Microstructure-property relationships between the macroscopie material behavior and microscopic structure.  Application to traditional structure as well as to new engineering materials.  Adapting emerging constitutive relations into structure analyses.  Introduction of this new approach to materials, its applications in predictive analysis tools, and its importance in simulation-based engineering. Typically offered Spring.
