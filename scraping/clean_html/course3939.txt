AT 60700 - Aviation Applications Of Bayesian Inference

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides a critical foundation necessary for understanding Bayesian theory and employing that theory in the analysis of typical data generated in industry. The course will focus specifically on solutions of aviation-related problems through data analysis. Material includes overview and implementation of relevant statistical software applications. Practical skills in presenting advanced analyses to both professional and scientific audiences is a key component of the course. Prerequsites:  AT 50700 OR IT 50700 OR STAT 30100 OR STAT 50100 OR STAT 51100. Permission of instructor required.
