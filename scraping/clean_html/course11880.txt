CE 40800 - Geographic Information Systems In Engineering

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an introduction to the application of geographic information systems (GIS) to civil engineering problems. GIS is a tool for analysis, modeling, and evaluation of civil engineering problems. The design of spatial databases, assembly of requisite data, and the development of analysis tools within GIS are presented. This course will address: definition of spatial data, data types, spatial relationships, computer operation on spatial data, topology in spatial data, representation of features in a GIS, data models, data dictionaries, data capture techniques; database types, composition of spatial queries, analysis of engineering data using a GIS, complex analysis of polygon and linear features, presentation of results, use of a GIS as an engineering model test bed.
