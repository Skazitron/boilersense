ENE 63000 - Cognitive Devices In Science, Technology, Engineering And Mathematics Learning Environments

Credit Hours: 3.00. This course explores the nature of technologies we use to assist in thinking, learning and teaching. Specific focus is on cognitive tools associated with engineering activities and how to blend these tools with science and mathematical knowledge. These will range from representational tools, computational tools and cognitive tools for supporting individual and group thinking and learning. Participants in this course will be able to evaluate various learning technologies relative to specific learning goals and outcomes and will design a technological tool to support thinking, learning and/or teaching about concepts in science, engineering, mathematics and technology. Participants will also be able to identify assessment methods that indicate cognitive change in learners as a measure of the effectiveness of a device/tool in context of an activity. Typically offered Spring.
