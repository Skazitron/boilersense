Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Apply techniques of integration (integration by parts, trigonometric substitution and partial fractions) to compute areas of planar regions, volumes of solids of revolution and areas of surfaces of revolution, work, moments and centers of mass of homogeneous laminas.
2.  Apply tests of absolute convergence of series to find the interval of convergence of some power series. 
3.  Find the Taylor and Maclaurin series of some exponential, rational and trigonometric functions. 
4.  Use polar coordinates to make it possible to sketch the graphs of some curves. 
5.  Understand the definition of a Riemann sum, and should be able to apply elementary approximation methods of integration.
