CS 50023 - Data Engineering I

Credit Hours: 1.00.  The course introduces students to the fundamentals of Data Engineering with a focus on tools and computational techniques to gather, construct, manipulate, summarize, and visualize data sets as a means to extract knowledge from the underlying data. Python and Python libraries are used. Completion of the course will allow learners to perform basic data analysis on data sets. Experience in Python Programming and Linear Algebra is required. The course also prepares learners for additional instruction in the courses Data Engineering II and Foundations of Decision Making.
