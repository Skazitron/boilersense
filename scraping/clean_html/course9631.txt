2.  Apply tests of absolute convergence of series to find the interval of convergence of some power series. 
3.  Find the Taylor and Maclaurin series of some exponential, rational and trigonometric functions. 
4.  Use polar coordinates to make it possible to sketch the graphs of some curves. 
5.  Understand the definition of a Riemann sum, and should be able to apply elementary approximation methods of integration.
