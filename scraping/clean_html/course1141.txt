AAE 54500 - Dynamic Behavior of Materials

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Materials' responses to high-rate loading are different from their quasi-static behavior. Applications of materials in structures subjected to impact loading from events such as bird strike require the understanding of dynamic material behavior. Such high-rate materials behavior is not available in standard materials handbooks or design manuals. This course introduces stress wave propagation in solids, which is the foundation to characterization and understanding of high-rate response of materials. Then, the theoretical background and working principles of high-rate experimental methods are presented to characterize the material response under high-rate loading conditions. Finally, rate-dependent material models are introduced to describe the dynamic material behavior and deformation mechanisms.
