ECE 45600 - Digital Integrated Circuit Analysis And Design

Credit Hours: 3.00.  As applied t digital integrated circuits, the MDs transistor is studied in depth-from its fabrication to its electrical characteristics. Combinational, sequential, and dynamic logic circuits are considered. While the focus of the course is on CMOS technology, bipolar, nMOS, and BiCMOS circuits are introduced as well. SPICE is used as both an analysis and design tool. Semiconductor memory circuits are also discussed.
