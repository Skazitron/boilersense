ME 67500 - Multivariable Control System Designs

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Fundamentals of the frequency response loop shaping methodology for the analysis and design of robust multivariable control systems will be presented. Emphasis is on suitable extensions of the classical Bode-Nyquist design techniques to systems with not only uncertain parameters but also multiple inputs and outputs. Instrument and environmental signal level constraints on the performance of control systems will be critically evaluated. Students are required to develop ability to handle open-ended design issues involving significant multiobjective performance trade-offs.  Prerequisite: ME 57500. Typically offered Spring.
