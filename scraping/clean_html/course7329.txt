MSE 52500 - Struct-Property Relationships Of Engineering Polymers

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Structure-property relationships developed for commodity and engineering resins. Focus on connecting bonding and polymer structure (i.e., molecular weight, tacticity, crystallinity as it regards spherulites) to mechanical (yield phenomena and fracture) and thermomechanical behavior (viscoelasticity). Thermal characterization techniques, including DSC, TGA, TMA, and DMTA. Flow of polymer melts related to common melt processing techniques (i.e., extrusion and injection molding).  Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Spring.
