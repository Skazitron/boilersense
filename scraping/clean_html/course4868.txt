CNIT 54200 - Design-Based Research Applications

Credit Hours: 3.00.  The course provides an opportunity for students to study and apply design-based research to evaluate and improve learning environments. Specifically, the course focuses on using design-based research as a methodological approach to combine instructional design and research in a cyclical and interdependent manner. Students are expected to apply this approach with the goal of simultaneously solving practical problems and developing a sharable theory by connecting design features to valued outcomes. Students should have prior knowledge of educational research methods, have an educational project to work on or a dataset ready to be analyzed.
