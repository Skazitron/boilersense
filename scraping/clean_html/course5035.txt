ECE 20001 - Electrical Engineering Fundamentals I

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course covers fundamental concepts and applications for electrical and computer engineers as well as for engineers who need to gain a broad understanding of these disciplines. The course starts by the basic concepts of charge, current, and voltage as well as their expressions with regards to resistors and resistive circuits. Essential concepts, devices, theorems, and applications of direct-current (DC), 1st order, and alternating-current (AC) circuits are subsequently discussed. Besides electrical devices and circuits, basic electronic components including diodes and transistors as well as their primary applications are also discussed.
