MSE 56000 - The Production Of Inorganic Materials

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Examination of the production of inorganic materials of engineering importance (metals, ceramics, and glasses) from ore concentrates, raw materials, and recycled materials. Individual stages in the extraction, refining, and syntheses processes are examined from the viewpoints of thermodynamics and kinetics, and alternative production routes are compared and contrasted. Topics covered include carbothermic and metallothermic reduction of oxide concentrates, smelting and conversion of sulfide mattes, electrolysis and electrowinning from aqueous solutions and molten salts, distillation and vacuum refining, glass-forming, and the synthesis of carbide and nitride ceramics. Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Fall.
