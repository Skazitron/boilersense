CHM 33901 - Biochemistry Laboratory

Credit Hours: 1.00.  CHM 33901 is a laboratory course based on two modules from the Undergraduate Research Inspired Experimental Chemistry Alternatives (URIECA) developed at MIT that are designed to introduce students to cutting-edge research topics in biochemistry. The course provides students with a research-inspired laboratory experience that introduces standard biochemical techniques in the context of investigating a current research topic, for example, acquired resistance to cancer drugs. Techniques include protein expression, purification, and gel analysis, PCR, site-directed mutagenesis, kinase activity assays, and protein structure viewing. CHM 33901 was designed as the 4th semester of the 1-2-1 competency-based curriculum transformation in chemistry as it applies to pre-health professional and life science students at Purdue. However, the course is open to other students who meet the pre-requisites.
