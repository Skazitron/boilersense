STAT 52600 - Advanced Statistical Methodology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  As a sequel to STAT 52500, this course introduces some statistical modeling tools that are developed for situations where least squares regression and standard ANOVA techniques may not naturally apply. One coverage centers around two lines of models that are closely related, the generalized linear models (GLM) for regression (and ANOVA) with non Gaussian responses, and survival models for the analysis of lifetime data. Among issues to be discussed are the estimation of the models, the testing of hypotheses, and the checking of model adequacy. Data examples will be used throughout the course to illustrate the methodologies and the related software tools in R.  Typically offered Fall Spring.
