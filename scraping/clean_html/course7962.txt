SLHS 30200 - Hearing Science

Credit Hours: 3.00.  An introduction to the scientific foundations of auditory sensation and perception.  The course covers those aspects of acoustics most pertinent to understanding auditory processing of simple and complex sounds (e.g. speech and music), the anatomy and physiology of the peripheral and central auditory systems, and a range of auditory perceptual phenomena and their physiological correlates.
