HIST 49400 - Science And Society In American Civilization

Subsequent treatment deals with industrialization, and maturation of the American scientific community, and the increasing social effects of science. Among those considered are the forces making for urbanization, for greater interdependence among science, industry and government, and for repercussions in intellectual affairs.
