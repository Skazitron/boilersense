ME 53100 - Characteristics Of Particles, Powders, And Compacts

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Familiarize students with the properties and methods used to characterize the mechanical behavior of particles, powders, and compacts, with the intention of using these properties for process and performance design. Students work with a subset of the measurement methods in a laboratory setting. Students successfully completing the course will be able to define and describe the significant properties of particles, powders, and compacts; describe and demonstrate techniques used to measure these properties; and demonstrate how these properties are useful in product and manufacturing performance. Offered alternate years. Typically offered Spring.
