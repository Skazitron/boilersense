ECE 60419 - Numerical Simulations Of Electro-Optic Energy Systems

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Introduction to computational techniques employed in research on energy systems involving quantum electronics and electromagnetics. You will learn the strengths and weaknesses of each approach; what types of problem call for which one; and how your simulation will perform. Techniques include eigenvalue problems, fast Fourier transforms, band structure calculations, rigorous-coupled wave analysis, beam-propagation methods, finite-difference time-domain, and finite element methods. Applications include nanophotonics, photovoltaics, thermal management, radiative control, and nonlinear optics. Prerequisite by Topic: Elect/Magn Interactions (ECE 60400 or equivalent); Programming For Engineers (C, MATLAB, or similar); Linear Algebra; Ordinary Differ. Equatn; and Signals and Systems.
