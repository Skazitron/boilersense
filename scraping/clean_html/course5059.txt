ECE 27900 - Sophomore Participation In Vertically Integrated Projects In Electrical And Computer Engineering

Credit Hours: 1.00 or 2.00.  This course provides an opportunity for undergraduate students to explore and develop comprehensive applications of electrical and computer engineering technologies, especially as they relate to active research areas of Purdue faculty members. Students will learn about the underlying research, and will work on teams to formulate applications of the research that address real-world needs. Students will attend a weekly lecture that provides an introduction to a broad range of applicable technologies and development tools - some associated with the activities of specific teams, and some addressing topics of more general value to students enrolled in the course.
