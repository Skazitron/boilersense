MSE 52300 - Physical Ceramics

Credit Hours: 3.00.  Physical and chemical processes responsible for microstructure development in modern ceramic materials, and the relationship between microstructures and physical properties. The material covered is divided into three parts: solid state processes, including structural defects, diffusion, sintering and grain growth, reaction rates, nucleation and growth, and microstructure development; mechanical and thermal behavior, including deformation, strength, thermal properties, and thermal and compositional stresses; and electrical and magnetic behavior, including electrical conductivity, dielectric properties, and magnetic properties.  Offered in alternate years. Typically offered Spring.
