VCS 80140 - Fundamental Principles Of Comparative Nutrition

Credit Hours: 2.00.  This course will cover fundamental aspects of comparative nutrition building on knowledge from veterinary comparative anatomy and physiology courses. Multiple species will be discussed to provide the student a broad-based foundational knowledge in key nutritional concepts, including feeds and feeding assessment and the animal's physiologic state/lifestage. The student will learn how physiologic status will impacts energy needs and nutritional adequacy, on an individual and/or group basis. The student will also develop skills in forage identification, pet food assessment, and when the individual/group is at risk of nutrient deficiency. Typically offered Spring Summer.
