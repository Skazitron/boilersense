ENGL 21800 - Figures Of Myth And Legends II: Heroes And Villains

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This class offers in-depth explorations of the larger-than-life leaders (on the side of good, and sometimes evil, too) who have become models for how we think of heroism, charisma, and what it means to seek and wield power over others. From the chivalric Knights of the Round Table to the frightening energy of the Viking comitatus bands, it will show that no models of mythic leadership come without their complications--or admirable qualities. Typically offered Fall Spring.
