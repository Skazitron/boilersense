Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Use analytical/empirical tools for determining the distribution of load (or displacement) in typical aerospace components.
2.  Understand and implement the procedures for relating applied loads (or displacements) to component "failure".
3.  Select of materials to resist structural failure.
