Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Compile a list of differential diagnoses based on clinical presentation and signalment. In other words, associate specific bacterial and fungal agents with animal species and affected body sites.
2.  Evaluate the properties of organisms (Gram pos/neg; Cocci/rod; Anaerobes/aerobes, etc.) on the differential diagnoses list in order to develop a diagnostic plan.
3.  Describe laboratory test methods used in diagnosis of bacterial and fungal diseases.
4.  Recognize bacterial and fungal pathogens that are zoonotic or reportable.
5.  Outline the pathogenesis of an organism from the host encounter, entry/multiplication/spread to damage to the host.
6.  Understand basic mechanisms of action, basic spectrum of activity, and major safety and legal concerns of antibacterial and antifungal therapeutics and disinfectants.
7.  Select appropriate therapy and control/prevention based on understanding of pathogens and therapeutic agents.
