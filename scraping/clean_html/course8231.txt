Learning Outcomes: 
1.  Have acquired a broad comprehension of the work, including economic activity often not recognized as "work", that women typically have performed or is typically associated with women, world-wide and since the onset of industrialization.
2.  Be capable of evaluating current global economic and cultural systems that impact what kinds of labor contemporary women perform, the conditions under which they work, and the nature of the gendered systems of labor that prevail in the U.S. and elsewhere.
3.  Gain appreciation for the significance of women's unpaid or underpaid care-work, relational work, affective labor, and the "reproductive" labor underpinning global capitalism and industrialism.
4.  Place their own personal lives and contexts within an analytical framework informed by feminist, Marxist, and intersectional perspectives on work and labor.
