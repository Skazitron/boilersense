TECH 53300 - Design Theory And Technology

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course provides an overview of theories and approaches to the transdisciplinary concept of design, spanning multiple disciplines and types of design outputs with a focus on technology. Students will read the work of leading design scholars, and situate their personal approach to design practice and research based on historical and current trends in the literature. Student work will be focused on theoretical and practical outcomes, with two main learning goals: 1) building upon and critiquing theories, methods, and processes of design in their original research; and 2) generating an awareness and representation of their personal design philosophy. Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
