This course examines both the traditional and contemporary forms of cybercrime, including hacking, insider threat, Internet child pornography, cyberbullying, hacktivism, and cyberterrorism. Students will learn how computers can be either the target (e.g., hacking) or the tool (e.g., child pornography) for committing cybercrimes. In addition, this course will apply a variety of sociological, psychological, and criminological theories to help explain, "Why do some people engage in cybercrimes when others do not?"
