TLI 46000 - Teaching Design And Innovation II

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This course expands the engineering design process, incorporating rapid prototyping and other fabrication technologies to create a specified solution. The course emphasizes process flow chart planning and logistics of engineering/technology education laboratory management.
Prototypes will be tested in real situations and data gathered on performance. Designs will be revised to reflect a deeper understanding of manufacturing and use, being sensitive to structure, function, and behavior from a systems-level perspective. Intellectual property, marketing, and infrastructure will be discussed.  Typically offered Fall Spring Summer.
