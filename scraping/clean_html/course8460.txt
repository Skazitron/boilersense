CGT 26000 - Introduction To Modeling For BIM

Credit Hours: 3.00.  This is an introduction to the materials and processes used when generating 3D modeled solutions to construction problems using traditional and emerging construction documentation standards. Construction documents are created based on current Architectural, Engineering and Construction (AEC) standards with a focus on residential settings - introduction sketching into 2D documentation that will progress into 3D modeling.
